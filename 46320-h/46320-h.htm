  <span class="drop-cap">T</span>he song of Wulnoth, the
born thrall, who was called
the Wanderer; the song of
the nameless and the landless
man who aided two
kings to gain kingdoms.</p>

for Guthred the prince;
the song of his wanderings
to find his friend. The song of his perils and warrings,
and of his slaying of Hungwar the Dane. The
song of his friendship with Alfred the Bretwalda of
the West Saxons, and of his love for Edgiva the
Beautiful. The song of his turning to the Life Giver;
the song of his last fight with Jarl Eric, on the field
of the great slaughter. This is the song.</p>

<p>"And this song did Gyso the Gleeman sing by
command of Edward the King, the son of Alfred,
that the name and the deeds of Wulnoth might not
perish, but be remembered by all men."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />

<small><em>How Wyborga the Wise spoke with
King Hardacnute</em></small></h2>


<p>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_011.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">F</span>ar across the dark sea
which rolls its waters to
the northeast of this England
of ours, there rise the
dark cliffs and frowning
heights of Norway's shores;
and there, in the days of old,
lived Hardacnute the King.</p>

<p>Far inland did his lands
extend, fair with many a
fertile field where broad streams flowed, and grim with
snow-clad peaks, from which the torrents roared and
foamed their way down to the sea.</p>

<p>On the cliff-top his castle was built, and around,
on many a height, could be seen the halls of jarl and
lord, each mighty in war, and each owning Hardacnute
as master and overlord.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>
<p>By night and by day did the warders guard his
towers; by night and by day were his long ships ready
to put to sea; by night and by day did a hundred shields
gleam in his halls, and a hundred spears rest beside
them; and by night and by day were there a hundred
strong hands ready to grasp the one or to prise the
other. For across the dark waves was the way of the
sea-kings, and no man could say when their long ships
might come sailing from Denmark or Juteland to carry
fire and sword along the coast.</p>

<p>Well it became the King to be watchful; and for
his watchfulness was there now peace in the land.</p>

<p>A great flaxen-haired man was this King, whose
blue eyes could gleam with anger or sparkle with merriment;
terrible was he in battle, and yet mild in the
hall, and dearly did he love Wulfreda his fair wife, and
little Guthred his son, who played in the great courtyard
with a tiny shield and spear, which Hald the Constable
had fashioned for him.</p>

<p>Blue-eyed and golden-haired was Guthred, with
more of his mother's gentle nature than of his father's
strong passion, so that Hardacnute frowned sometimes,
and said that the boy was too timid, and that he feared
pain; but old Hald would laugh and answer&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let be, O King; the tender shoot hath not the
rough bark of the old tree. Let be. Guthred will prove
a brave holda yet."</p>

<p>Now, some way from the King's castle there dwelt
a wise woman, one who knew many things that other
people could not understand, yet one who used her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>power well, and did not seek to cast spells upon man
or beast; and it chanced that one day this wise woman
came along the road by the castle as the King came
riding home from the hunting, with his dogs leaping
and the slain bear carried between two sturdy carls.
Some of the dogs were fierce, but they tried not to harm
old Wyborga; and the King saw, as he rode past on his
great horse, that she looked pale and weary, as if from
a journey.</p>

<p>So the King called to one of his followers to light
from his steed, and he bade Wyborga ride with him to
the castle; and he took her to the hall and treated her
with honor, and gave her food and sweet mead, for
King Hardacnute was ever kind to the old and the
young, and to women.</p>

<p>And while Wyborga sat at meat, little Guthred
came and played at her side, and laughed up into her
face, and the wise woman placed one hand on his fair
head and looked into his eyes and sighed, so that the
King said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why do you sigh, O mother, when you look into
the eyes of this my son?"</p>

<p>"Because of what I see there, O King," answered
the wise woman. And the King asked again&mdash;</p>

<p>"And what is it that you see, O mother?"</p>

<p>"A long journey to a far land, for a kingdom,"
answered Wyborga; and at that the King laughed
heartily.</p>

<p>"Why, truly, mother, that is but a little thing, for
the sea is the road of the sea-kings; and though Guthred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>will be king in my place when I have passed to the
storm land, yet it may well be that he will carry fire
and sword across the sea, and conquer other lands."</p>

<p>"Not fire nor sword will Guthred carry across the
sea, O King," she answered, "nor will he reign as king
here in thy stead, though he shall be king of a greater
realm than thine. The thrall collar shall he wear, and
the thrall's part shall he play, yet shall he become a
king in his day, and a thrall shall help him to his
kingdom."</p>

<p>Now, at that the King paused and pondered, and
his brow was troubled, but he said at last&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thy riddle is too hard for me, mother, and it
seems dark with evil, for how shall my son become a
thrall?"</p>

<p>"Thrall makers ride the sea, O King," she answered.
And the King said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yet where shall the King be when they come,
O mother?" And again she made reply&mdash;</p>

<p>"The sword has a death-song for each in turn, O
King."</p>

<p>"Now truly, mother," cried the King, "this is a
hard thing you say to me, after you have eaten at my
table. Evil did I do to bring you here as my guest."</p>

<p>"Not evil, O King," Wyborga answered, "but
good. And now listen to my words, O King. This
thing will not be yet, and before it comes, over the
Westarweg shall come wanderers seeking food and
shelter. Be they poor or be they rich, high or low, let
thy hand be to them, King, for of their number one will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>be the friend of Guthred the Prince. A thrall shall take
the thraldom from the Prince, and that a thrall who
shall mate with a king's daughter; and now&mdash;I go in
peace, and thanks for thy kindness."</p>

<p>So Wyborga went her way, and the King pondered
and was troubled. Much that she had said he
could not understand, but this one thing seemed clear:
the wise woman had foretold that foes would come and
slay him and carry his little son away into captivity,
and that seemed heavy tidings to King Hardacnute.
Therefore he called in all his servants, and had great
stores of food prepared for siege, and night and day
kept watch and ward for the foe who should come
across Westarweg, as they called the dark sea.</p>

<p>But no foes came; not a single dark sail appeared,
not a single shield shone over the waves to catch the
gleams of the sun; and at last the King laughed away
his fears, and said that surely Wyborga the Wise must
have lost her wisdom.</p>

<p>But in that the King was wrong, for had not
Wyborga said that this would not be yet, and that ere
the foe arrived wanderers would come seeking shelter
and succor? King Hardacnute had forgotten that part
of the prophecy.</p>

<p>But when the summer waned and the sea grew
wild with the winter gales, when the ice came down
from the North, to gleam ghost-like as it slowly floated
by, when even the bravest of the sea-kings would have
trembled to launch his stout ships&mdash;then, one day,
as the pale sun died away and the fierce tempests
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>sprang up, the warder came to say that out on the sea
a ship of some sort was to be seen; and at that all men
ran to their posts, for perchance this might be the
enemy that the wise woman had foretold.</p>

<p>But when the King reached the castle walls and
gazed out into the storm wrack, there, beating and
buffeted and sore tried, he saw one poor boat, such as
the fisher folk use, drifting almost at the mercy of the
tempest, and yet seeking to make its way to the shelter
of Lethra Fiord.</p>

<p>"Now who can these be?" cried the King. "What
madman would put to sea in such a craft on such a
night?" But to that old Hald answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"Not all who put to sea do so willingly, O King.
These are some poor castaways; and it minds me that
the wise woman foretold the coming of some such. So
I will get me down to the water with some stout hearts,
and render them what aid I may."</p>

<p>Then the King gave permission, and Hald and his
men went down and launched one of the King's ships
to the storm, and with straining oars and slanting sail
they came round and rendered help to the storm-beaten
ones, and got them safely back, and carried them into
King Hardacnute's hall and set them in his presence,
so that he might see them for himself.</p>

<p>And the King stared, and perchance he frowned
a little, for it seemed a foolish thing to endanger his
stout hearts to rescue these travellers, seeing that they
were but three, and poorly dressed like carls, and,
moreover, two of them wore the collars of thralls.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>
<p>There was a man, big and stalwart, with bold
defiant eyes, and erect head, and he had a thrall collar;
and there was a woman, fair and timid; and between
them they held a child, a boy of about the
young Prince's age, but more stalwart and well-knit,
and he also had around his little neck the badge of
slavery.</p>

<p>The three stood there waiting for the King to
speak, and yet for the moment the King made no sound,
for he gazed upon that child. A bold daring child he
seemed. Tender of years though he was, his eyes were
blue as the bluest summer sky, and his long hair shone
yellow gold, as though the sun had kissed it; and the
King looked and wondered, and thought that he had
never seen so fair a child, no, not even when he looked
at his own little son, Prince Guthred.</p>

<p>And while he sat looking, the Prince himself ran
into the hall brandishing his tiny spear and shield, and
seeing a little one of his own age, he ran to him, flourishing
his baby weapons.</p>

<p>But the little stranger did not flinch; though the
spear-head grazed his arm, he only smiled. And then
Guthred slipped and fell, and his shield and spear went
flying across the hall, so that the little stranger ran
and gathered them up and then aided the Prince, and
gave him his weapons back and stood beside him, his
arm round the other's neck, as though he were holda
and noble, and not a churl's child. Thereat the King
frowned, and then he turned to the man and spoke and
asked him whence he came, and who he was, and how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>came he to be in the boat, with woman and child, on
such a stormy day?</p>

<p>"Wast thou washed away against thy will?" he
asked, "and dost thou desire to be safely sent back to
thy lord?" And at that the face of the man darkened,
and the woman began to weep, while the child seized
the baby spear, and cried so that even the King heard
his shrill voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"My father, better this than to go back now."</p>

<p>"Now," said the King, "truly we have a young
wolf cub here. Tell me your story, friend, that I may
learn that from which you flee, and why this child,
who is little more than a babe, talks so largely of
choosing the kiss of the spear before return to that
place from whence ye came. Methinks this means that
we have thralls who have fled from their thraldom."</p>

<p>And then the man stepped forward, and he spoke,
and his voice sounded strong and clear; nor, though
he was in the presence of the King, did he show any
fear.</p>

<p>"Truly, O King, this child speaks well," he said;
"for there is no going back for us. And, truly, as thou
sayest, we are thralls, and thralls who have fled from
thraldom, seeing that is worse than death. Know, O
King, that I am Cerdic, the son of Elchere; and this
woman is Olfa, and this child is our son Wulnoth&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thou art Saxon, then, if thy name speaks truly,"
said the King. "How comes one of the name of the
noble Cerdic to wear a thrall's collar?"</p>

<p>"This is the matter of it, O King," Cerdic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>answered. "Of the blood of Cerdic am I; yet, as thou
perchance knowest, the sons of Cerdic sailed across
the Westarweg to the land of East Anglia, leaving
Tholk to rule in the place where they were born. Yet
Tholk was unworthy, and made a league with Berwulf
the Viking; whereat I and others rebelled, and were
therefore made landless and nameless, and the thrall
collars were placed upon us. Yet this I might have
abided, though the blood of jarls was in my veins; but
this Berwulf broke his treaty, and put Tholk to death
and made himself lord in his place; and because I
would not own him he had me beaten with rods, and
would have had me slain but that I burst my bonds
and struck him down with his own axe; and then,
escaping, made to the sea with my wife and my son.
For it was better to trust to the fury of the winter
storms than to abide the cruel wrath of Viking Berwulf.
For six long days and nights have we battled
with the tempests, while the storm sisters have ridden
around us; and then we sighted thy walls, O King.
And, now that we are here, either slay us or send us
on our way if thou canst not keep us here; but send
us not back to Berwulf, who, methinks, would be as
much thy foe as mine."</p>

<p>Then did King Hardacnute swear a mighty oath
by Thor's hammer that no harm should come to Cerdic
or his while he bided in Lethra.</p>

<p>"These Danish pirates," he cried, "are foes to all
honest men, and each should help the other against
them. Bide thou here in safety, Cerdic, son of Elchere,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>thou and thine, and no harm shall come to thee. But
as for thy thrall collar, it was put on by thy lord because
thou didst rebel against him; and it is not meet
that I should take it off until thou hast proved thyself
in the man's game, making the sword sing the death
song in the ears of thy foes."</p>

<p>"That will I do when the time comes, O King,"
answered Cerdic. "For the rest, I am content, and
my service is thine."</p>

<p>"Thou shalt have house and a piece of land," said
the King, "and my Stallere shall allow thee grazing;
and as for thy little son&mdash;"</p>

<p>But then a little voice spoke, and Prince Guthred
ran to his father's side, crying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wulnoth must stay with me, O father. Wulnoth
must stay and be my playmate." And at that the King
laughed and said that it should be so.</p>

<p>So this is how little Wulnoth, the child of a fugitive
and a thrall, and himself wearing a thrall collar,
came to dwell in the King's hall and to play with Guthred
the Prince; and though some of the jarls and warriors
frowned and said that this thing should not be,
the King took little heed; and the Queen smiled on
the boy who played with her own son, and the two lads
were happy together.</p>

<p>And all this time there was peace in the land, and
no sign of the viking lords coming with fire and sword;
and all this time did the King have watch and ward
kept.</p>

<p>But sometimes, as he stood on his tower and looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>over the long, rolling waves of the Westarweg, he
would think of the words of Wyborga, and wonder
within himself whether they would ever come true.</p>

<p>Now, this is how Wyborga the Wise prophesied
evil tidings to the King; and this is how Cerdic, and
Olfa his wife, and Wulnoth their son, came from the
storm-sea to dwell in the King's land.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

<small><em>How Wulnoth saved Edgiva from
the Bear</em></small></h2>


<p>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_022.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">S</span>o Cerdic the Saxon took
service with the King of
Lethra; and the King gave
him a cottage and a piece
of land, where he lived with
Olfa his wife. But Wulnoth
his son was most of
his time up in the King's
hall playing with the little
Prince Guthred; and, though
some of the nobles frowned, a great friendship sprang
up between the two children, so that they called each
other brother, and each shared the other's joys and sorrows;
and it was hard to say whether Guthred was
most happy when he was with Wulnoth in Cerdic's
cottage, or Wulnoth, when he was in the King's courtyard
with the Prince.</p>

<p>And three years passed away with their sun and
their snow, and still it was peace in the land, and the
vikings did not appear. For some had gone to Angle
Land, where there were fertile fields to be seized; and
some had followed the mighty Hrolf&mdash;who was called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>The Walker, because he was so heavy that no horse
could bear his weight&mdash;into Normandy to war against
Charles the Simple; and others, again, had journeyed
over the mighty river and the snow-clad mountains to
carry fire and sword into the provinces of the Romans.</p>

<p>And in those three years the two boys grew strong
and sturdy, and now they were each fourteen years
old; yet still Wulnoth was the stronger.</p>

<p>If Guthred could run swiftly, Wulnoth could beat
him. If Guthred could wrestle with any son of the
jarls, Wulnoth could throw Guthred. If Guthred could
send an arrow to the mark, Wulnoth could split the
Prince's shaft from feather to head; so that the King
said that the wolf cub would grow into a fine wolf one
of these days and do great deeds in the land.</p>

<p>And though Wulnoth could best the Prince in
most things, there was neither jealousy nor quarrellings;
but the two boys loved like brothers, though
Wulnoth never forgot that he was but a thrall's son,
and wore thrall collar. The Prince would forget that,
but Wulnoth never did, and he ever spoke of his companion
as "my friend and Prince."</p>

<p>Now, you must know that about the time that Cerdic
had first come to Lethra, the little Princess Edgiva
was born; so that now she was three years old; and
throughout all the land, yea, and throughout all wide
Norway, there was not another child so beautiful as
Edgiva, the daughter of Hardacnute.</p>

<p>Her skin was like the pink blush of the morning
sky, or the tender leaf of the rose-bud; her teeth were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>like the purest pearls, and her eyes blue as the rarest
sapphire; while, as for her hair, never spider spun
thread so fine, never gold gleamed and played in the
sunlight so brightly, and never down of the thistle, or
wool of the sheep, was so soft.</p>

<p>The scalds sang songs in her praise, and said that
when she grew up she would be the fairest woman in
all the world, fit to become bride of the mightiest of
kings.</p>

<p>And a dear, sweet, loving child she was, with a
smile for all and a frown for none, except those who
did wrong; and of all in Lethra she smiled most upon
the little thrall-boy, Wulnoth; and Wulnoth was
never so happy, no, not even when playing with Guthred,
as when he was sitting watching Edgiva.</p>

<p>It was his strong brown hand that first held her
as she tried to walk; and when they bought a little
pony for her, it was Wulnoth who walked by her side
and held the bridle, lest the creature should rear and
throw his precious burden.</p>

<p>And at this some of the lords were more angry
than ever; for they said it was a high honor for any
lad to attend Princess Edgiva, and that their sons
should come before a mere churl. And perchance the
King would have listened to their speech, but that
Wulfreda, the Queen, said their daughter liked the boy,
and that it was a princess's right to choose her own servant;
while as for old Hald the Constable, he laughed
until the tears came into his fierce eyes, and he cried&mdash;</p>

<p>"By Odin! but some people are ever jealous, let
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>what may happen. The boy is right, O King; and he
has the thews of a young viking and the heart of a
hero; and there is no peril would touch Edgiva while
Wulnoth stood unwounded."</p>

<p>Hald, old and renowned as he was, had a big heart,
and he did not forget that though he was noble and
jarl now, his own father had been a churl until the day
of his death.</p>

<p>So, despite frowns and grumblings, Wulnoth
walked by the side of the Princess; and he and Guthred
called themselves her knights, and waited upon her
pleasure and delighted to do her bidding.</p>

<p>Now, all this time nothing had been seen of Wyborga
the wise woman; for she had been a journey
to places afar, as was her custom at certain seasons,
despite her age; and the King had forgotten all about
her dark sayings, or, if ever he remembered them, it was
but as the idle tale of a poor old crone, whose wits had
gone with the years that were fled. King Hardacnute
ruled wisely and well, and was at peace with his neighbors,
and the land was happy.</p>

<p>Only sometimes Hald and other old warriors would
shake their heads when they took counsel together,
and they would say&mdash;</p>

<p>"The times are too easy, and the people are too
slow. They forget the hardships of war-time, and if
the sword came into the land again, it would go hard
with us."</p>

<p>Well, one summer's day, when the fields were
bright with flowers and the corn grew high, almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>ready for the reaping, and when the kine stood knee
deep in the long grass in the valleys, Prince Guthred
and Wulnoth set out for a long ramble, and between
them, on her little pony, Edgiva rode, a garland of
white blossoms, which Wulnoth had fashioned, upon
her beautiful hair.</p>

<p>All the world seemed bright and beautiful: the
sun shone, and the birds sang, and the brooks rippled,
and all seemed to say to them&mdash;"Waes heal to you,
little travellers&mdash;waes heal to the three fair ones."
The squirrels played in the branches, and the sea-birds
screamed as they passed overhead, and the great,
lazy pigs grunted as they rolled in the woodland shade,
and all seemed to say&mdash;"Waes heal to the three fair
ones."</p>

<p>So they went through the meadow-land; and they
went through the woodland glade, where the great
ferns spring up and the good people hide from men's
eyes all the day long, waiting for the gloaming, to
creep out and dance their fairy dances; and yet, though
they looked carefully and peered into many a tiny glen
and sat without the least sound for quite ten minutes,
never one of the good people could they see, but only
the rabbits and the wild birds, and the little darting
lizards.</p>

<p>And presently they came to a dell, and there they
sat and ate their cakes, which they had brought with
them, and drank from the skin of milk, which Wulnoth
had brought especially for Edgiva&mdash;for he and the
Prince would have had the cool water from the brook,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>only the Princess insisted that they three, who were
friends, should share all things equally.</p>

<p>And while they sat there, a stick cracked in the
woods, and Wulnoth started up, ready to guard the
Princess if need be: for if a stick cracked some foot
must have pressed it.</p>

<p>But no foe, either man or beast, came into the
glade, but only an old woman with gentle face and
kindly eyes, and hair white as the snow from the north;
and this woman said, as she surveyed the children&mdash;</p>

<p>"Greeting to you, little ones. All good greeting
to you." And they answered her&mdash;</p>

<p>"All good greeting to you also, good mother."</p>

<p>"And who are you, and how are you called?"
asked the woman; "and how is it that a prince and
princess have a thrall for their playmate?"</p>

<p>Then the Prince looked angry, for he did not like
people to speak so to his dear Wulnoth; and even
little Edgiva looked pained. But Wulnoth only
laughed, and he made reply&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good mother, the great and high, if they are
good and true, may hold out hand to the poor and gain
no dishonor thereby. And those who are lowly born
may take such friendship, and yet no harm be done;
and so it is in this case."</p>

<p>"Thou hast answered well and truly, Wulnoth,
son of Cerdic," the woman said; and at that Wulnoth
stared, and demanded how she knew his name.</p>

<p>"I know many things," answered the woman, who
was really old Wyborga returning from her travels to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>her own house. "I know many things, and this is one
of them&mdash;many wonderful things."</p>

<p>"Tell us some more of thy wonderful things, good
mother," pleaded the little Princess. "Tell us, for we
are fond of wonder tales."</p>

<p>"Not now, little Princess," answered the wise
woman; "go on with your play. And you, little Prince,
when you get back home, say to your father the King
that Wyborga sends him greeting, and says that the
time draws nigh."</p>

<p>"What time, good mother?" asked Guthred curiously;
but Wyborga shook her head.</p>

<p>"A dark time, little Prince, for thee and for thine,
of which thou mayst not know now. But remember
when sorrow and tears come, as come they will, that
manhood and honor are better than a throne. Remember
that a prince's word, and the word of every true
man, must be kept, though death be the price of the
keeping. Prince Guthred, remember this."</p>

<p>"Now truly, good mother," cried Wulnoth, "you
do speak very hard things; and, truly, methinks you
had little need to ask our names, seeing that without
being told you have mentioned them all to us." And
at that Wyborga smiled again.</p>

<p>But then little Edgiva drew close to her, and she
again asked her of her wonder stories.</p>

<p>"Cannot you tell us even one?" she said; "not
one about Odin or Thor and the heroes who dwell in
Walhalla? For these are the most wonderful stories
of all."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>
<p>"Not the most wonderful, nor the most beautiful
of all, little Princess," was the answer. "I know of
one far better, far more wonderful, and far more beautiful."
And at this they all three asked eagerly what
this wonderful story could be.</p>

<p>"Oh, so wonderful and so beautiful," answered
Wyborga. "The hearing of it turns sorrow to joy,
and makes darkness become light, and weakness turn
into strength. But you may not hear it yet; for, if
I told it to you, you would not understand it. Yet
this I promise, that one day you all three shall hear it."</p>

<p>"And will sorrow become joy, and weakness
strength, and darkness light, when we hear it?" cried
Wulnoth. And Wyborga nodded and said: "It will
indeed."</p>

<p>"But when and where shall we hear it?" the children
asked. "Shall we come to you again?"</p>

<p>"Nay," answered the wise woman; "you will hear
it from other lips, and in another land."</p>

<p>"But what shall be the sign that we shall hear
it?" asked the Prince, "and how shall we know that
it is the story when it is told?"</p>

<p>"Because it will turn weakness into strength," said
Wulnoth. "We are sure to know then."</p>

<p>"And sorrow into joy, and darkness into light,"
added Edgiva. "Oh, we shall be sure to know,
brother."</p>

<p>"I will give you a sign," the wise woman said.
And she took two little pieces of rough wood from the
ground, and with a piece of grass, she bound them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>together in the form of a cross. Then she plucked a
little spray of wild thorn and wound it round her cross
and held it up; and she said, and her voice was soft
and sweet, like the sigh of the summer wind amidst the
forest leaves, "This is the sign, dear children. One
day you will come to this sign, and then you will hear
the most wonderful and the most beautiful story in all
the wide world; and when you hear that, you will never
want to hear of Odin or Thor any more."</p>

<p>Then she turned and walked away, and not another
word could they get from her. So they turned to start
on their homeward way, wondering what that strange
sign could possibly mean, and what this story could be
about.</p>

<p>And as they journeyed on, back through the woodlands,
suddenly Edgiva's little pony stopped and
planted its forefeet firmly and laid back its ears, snorting
and trembling as if with fear.</p>

<p>"What can be the matter with him?" asked Prince
Guthred. "There is nothing to frighten him."</p>

<p>"Be not so sure of that, Prince," said Wulnoth.
"The pony may see more than we can; I have heard
that animals can see warlocks and wizards when they
are invisible to mortal eyes."</p>

<p>"Then what shall we do for Edgiva?" cried Guthred.
"We must not let warlocks harm her."</p>

<p>"Let me get down and pat him," Edgiva said.
"I will gather him a handful of sweet grass and then
he will go on."</p>

<p>So they helped her to alight; but alas, no sooner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>had her foot touched the ground than they heard a
dreadful sound, a deep, angry growl of rage and hate;
and there, emerging from the undergrowth, with eyes
ablaze and with yellow gleaming fangs, they saw an
immense old he bear, a real wood-roamer, a honey-finder,
who now was seeking for no honey.</p>

<p>And the pony, with a snort of terror, started off as
fast as it could go, leaving the children alone there,
with the monster approaching them.</p>

<p>For a moment Prince Guthred stood bewildered,
and little Edgiva clasped her tiny hands in terror; for,
indeed, this seemed a very dreadful creature, and its
size was so vast and its claws so long, and it seemed
to be saying to itself as it came along&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ho, ho! Here is a fine meal for me. This is
better than risking the swineherd's spear when I go
stealing the pigs. Ho, ho! This is much better."</p>

<p>Of course, the bear did not really say that; but
that is what it seemed to the children; so it is no
wonder that they were frightened.</p>

<p>"Run, Guthred! Run! Take Edgiva and run!"
screamed Wulnoth frantically. "I will stay here and
keep the bear busy."</p>

<p>But even in his terror Prince Guthred remembered
that Wulnoth was his friend, and it seemed a
hard thing to him to run away and leave him alone.</p>

<p>But Wulnoth cried again&mdash;"Run with thy sister,
Prince. Edgiva must be before all."</p>

<p>So Prince Guthred caught up Edgiva in his strong
arms and began to run, while Wulnoth threw a stone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>at the bear to make him turn his way. But the bear
did not turn; perhaps he thought that two children
were better than one&mdash;but he commenced to rush after
Guthred, with great roars of rage; and Wulnoth ran
after the bear, calling him a coward and a nithing, and
bidding him stop and fight; and, as he ran, he unsheathed
his stout knife and held it ready. It was the
only weapon he had, and the stoutest hunters might
have been forgiven if they had feared to attack such
a monster with no better arms. But Wulnoth did not
think of that. Edgiva must be saved, and he and that
knife must save her.</p>

<p>And just then Guthred caught his foot in a trailing
bramble, and fell, and the bear was now very nigh
them. But Wulnoth was also very near to the bear,
running so swiftly that the blades of grass had not even
time to bend beneath his weight before he had passed
on, and the gleaming knife was ready in his hand.</p>

<p>Now Wulnoth knew full well that the bear would
not harm the others without first rising on his hind
legs&mdash;for that is the way in which the bears always
attack&mdash;and for that he was ready and waiting.</p>

<p>The bear stopped with a clumsy jerk just as Guthred
scrambled to his feet, and it opened its great paws
wide to seize the boy. But Wulnoth was there, and
he pushed Guthred aside and darted under the bear's
paws, and buried his knife in its broad, hairy chest,
once, twice, and yet a third time, swifter than the
lightning plays or the adder darts. Then the bear
roared, and strove to bite with its wide-open, slavering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>jaws, and it dug its long claws deeply into Wulnoth's
back, and tore muscle and flesh to the bone. But that
was all it could do. It had no strength left, and it fell
on its side and struggled and died; and Wulnoth uttered
a mighty shout of joy, and thought nothing of his painful
wounds, for he had done a man's deed and had
saved Edgiva and his friend the Prince.</p>

<p>And Guthred and Edgiva came to him and strove
to check the blood that dripped from his hurts, and the
Princess would make him sit while she used her own
scarf for this purpose.</p>

<p>"Oh, Wulnoth!" cried Guthred, "surely here is the
story already, for weakness has become strength, and you
have conquered the waster while I fled like a nithing."</p>

<p>"Wulnoth has been brave," said Edgiva, "but you
have naught to grieve for, dear brother. As for the
story, this cannot be it, for the sign of the thorn and
the cross are not here."</p>

<p>"Let us not worry about stories," laughed Wulnoth,
and he was as happy as could be. Indeed, his
only sorrow was that Guthred had not slain a bear
also, so that they could have been alike. "Let us
skin this monster and take his coat home for the Princess
to have a rug for her feet."</p>

<p>So they set to work, the two boys, and though
it was a long job, they got the bear's skin, together
with its mighty head and paws; and then they found
the pony again, for that was grazing in a field hard by,
and they put the skin on its back and Edgiva on the
skin, and set off again.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>
<p>And when they reached the castle, and the soldiers
saw the skin, they clustered round in wonder, asking
who had killed the monster. Wulnoth would have said
little, but Guthred said much, and the men caught
Wulnoth up and cried, "Skoal" to him, and carried
him into the hall and set him down before the King,
and laid the head and the claws and the great skin on
the floor.</p>

<p>And now again Wulnoth would have said little, for
he was modest and did not like to boast, and besides,
he did not want to seem braver than the Prince, who
would have done as he had done if the chance had been
his. But Guthred and Edgiva stood at the King's side
and told of the fight, and made Wulnoth show his
wounds, and the King said that Wulnoth had done
a man's deed, and asked him what his reward should be.</p>

<p>Now, the King had expected that the boy would
ask that the thrall collar should be taken from his neck
and from his father's, but Wulnoth made no such
request.</p>

<p>"O King," he said, "if, as thou sayest, I have done
a man's deed, let a man's weapons be given to me now,
and let it be my place to guard Edgiva thy daughter,
and to sleep across the threshold at night."</p>

<p>Then, for a moment, the King paused and frowned,
for a memory came of the words of Wyborga that a
thrall should marry a king's daughter; and he wondered
whether that thrall was to be this boy, and the
king's daughter Edgiva; for if he had thought that,
though Wulnoth had slain the bear and preserved the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>Princess, he would have driven his spear through him
as he stood, and so have made an end of the matter.</p>

<p>Then, when the jarls heard this thrall-boy's words,
they cried out that he should be beaten with sticks for
his presumption.</p>

<p>"Shall the son of a churl be made the Princess's
guardian?" they cried. "Are there no sons of noble
birth in the land, O King?"</p>

<p>But Wulnoth stood out, and turned and showed
them the deep wounds made by the claws of the bear,
and he cried&mdash;</p>

<p>"Many there be more noble in the land, but are
there any who would have dared more? Did the bear
wound me more lightly than he would have wounded
any man? Are these wounds less painful to the churl
than they would be to the noble? The King asked me
what I desired, and I have answered. I want no other
gift, and if this may not be, then let be."</p>

<p>"He talks like a man," some laughed; but old
Hald, who liked the boy, answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"And by the hammer of Thor, he acts like one,
and I am minded that our Edgiva would have little
to fear with Wulnoth the son of Cerdic as her armed
man."</p>

<p>"The thing shall be," answered the King, and when
that was said all had to obey. "Wulnoth shall be given
sword and spear and shield, and his shall it be to guard
the Princess, and if any harm comes to her, then his
head shall pay the penalty. I have spoken, and the
thing is."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>
<p>So Wulnoth the boy was given the war tools of
a man, and he was appointed the guardian of the Princess,
which is just what he had appointed himself in
the past, only then he had no weapons save his knife.</p>

<p>But when King Hardacnute heard the message
which Wyborga had sent to him, his face grew very
grave, for it showed him that if he had forgotten, the
wise woman had remembered, and that the time was
drawing near when war time should be in the land.</p>

<p>And also the children spoke of the wonder tale
that Wyborga had hinted at, and of the strange thorn
cross which she had made; and the King listened and
answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"By Thor, I can make nothing of it! 'T is like
her other tale, and it may be that the one has as much
in it as the other."</p>

<p>Now, this is how Wulnoth saved Edgiva from the
bear, and how he won the man's tools and was appointed
watcher over the Princess. And this is how
Wyborga the Wise came again into the land, and
showed the three children the sign of the thorn-crowned
cross.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

<small><em>How Wulnoth journeyed by the Birds'
Road</em></small></h2>


<p>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_037.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">S</span>o Wulnoth became the
guard to watch over Princess
Edgiva, and some of
King Hardacnute's warriors
were wroth, and said that the
thing was a shame, and that
even if it were not so, a boy
like Cerdic's son should not
be given such an honorable
task when many a young
noble would have been glad to accept such trust.</p>

<p>But though Wulnoth was indeed a boy in years,
yet in stature and in strength he was a match for many
above his age, so tall and so lusty was he. And old Hald
laughed again when he heard these words, and he
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"The wolf cub is almost grown; let those beware
its fangs who would pull its ears."</p>

<p>And amongst those who were angered at the
King's choice was the keeper of the arms, Æthelmar;
and he, to spite the boy, gave him the weapons of the
strongest&mdash;the heaviest spear and the weightiest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>sword and shield; and he in his turn laughed and said
to himself&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now we shall see how Hald's wolf cub will bear
the weight of the toys he has asked for."</p>

<p>Wulnoth knew his weapons were too heavy, but
he was too proud to seek to have them altered, and he
would have borne them in patience but that Hald saw
him; and the old Constable stopped and stroked his
beard, and asked him who it was who gave him his
man's tools.</p>

<p>"Now, these are too weighty for you," he said
when Wulnoth had answered him, "and it was but a
poor trick of Æthelmar's to give such to you. You
must have lighter ones, my young warrior."</p>

<p>But Wulnoth answered that since he had been
given these he would keep them, and even Æthelmar
should see that his strength was equal to his task.</p>

<p>"Not so," said the Constable, quietly, when he
heard the boy's words. "That only comes from a
proud heart, and the Princess must not be endangered
because of your pride."</p>

<p>"How could the Princess be endangered?" cried
Wulnoth. "I do not see that, Hald."</p>

<p>"Weapons that you cannot use are as if you had
no weapons at all, Wulnoth," replied Hald. "How, if
you had to use that long spear, which is too clumsy for
you, or that sword which is too heavy? The Princess
might suffer harm because you could not well protect
her. We must have this remedied, my son."</p>

<p>And Hald was as good as his word, and gave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>Wulnoth man's tools more suited to his strength, and
he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let not pride make thee fall, Wulnoth. If they
laugh at thee for having these, thou canst the better
show them thy skill when the day of testing comes."</p>

<p>At that Wulnoth was content, and though some
laughed at him, he answered laugh with laugh, and
never bore himself like a boaster, nor was led to talk
of what he could do, but he only answered when such
questions were put to him&mdash;</p>

<p>"One cannot say what he will do until the test
comes. When the hour is, then I hope I shall not prove
a nithing, and meanwhile I cannot do better than watch
such skilled warriors as you who now laugh at my
youth."</p>

<p>Now, that showed that Wulnoth was wise, for had
he answered angrily he would but have been laughed at
the more, and would have made many enemies, whereas
now the soldiers said that he was modest and well-spoken,
and they taught him many things relating to
war; and Cerdic his father, each day when the boy
used to visit him, made him exercise both with sword
and spear, and in running and wrestling; and Prince
Guthred would exercise with him, so that he, too, might
become a mighty champion in his day, and go to the
wars with his friend.</p>

<p>But the Prince was not so cunning nor so strong
as Wulnoth, and, moreover, he was more gentle and
tender; and sometimes the King his father would be
angry, and say that he was more fitted to handle a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>distaff than to hurl a spear. But the King was wrong&mdash;the
boy was gentle and kind, but his heart was brave,
and he was patient, more patient than Wulnoth even,
and he who has learnt patience has learnt a mighty
lesson.</p>

<p>But in all this time no sign of the sea-kings was
seen, though by day and night watch was kept, and all
along the coast the great beacons were piled ready for
the lighting should the long ships of the pirates be
sighted upon the waves.</p>

<p>And the King laughed, and said that surely Wyborga
the Wise was wise no longer, for her stories,
though they were ill-omened, did not come true.</p>

<p>As for the skin of the wood-roamer, that was made
into a foot rug for Edgiva, and the head and the paws
were placed in the King's hall, with a rude writing beneath,
made by Reinbaldus the Scald, to tell how Wulnoth,
the son of Cerdic, slew the monster with his knife.</p>

<p>So the days passed away, and now Wulnoth was
fifteen, and his little Princess was nigh five years old,
and so beautiful to gaze upon that the buds of the
flowers would open as she passed, so that they might
look at that which was more beautiful than they were;
and the wild birds would gather o'er her head, and sing
their songs in honor of the fairest of children; and
already the jarls spoke to their young sons and bade
them strive to excel in strength and in war, so that when
the time came for Edgiva to be given in marriage they
might be amongst the mightiest who should strive for
her hand.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>
<p>Now it chanced one day that Guthred the Prince,
and his sister, and Wulnoth her watcher went together
into the woods nigh to the spot where they had met
the bear&mdash;for they feared no bear now, nor yet the
surliest of the wild boars&mdash;and while they tarried in
the woodland shade Wyborga the Wise came and
greeted them, and asked how they fared. And Edgiva
went to her side and answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"O good mother, we fare well, but we have not
yet heard the wonder tale, nor have we found the sign&mdash;the
thorn-covered cross&mdash;though we have looked
long and searched far for it."</p>

<p>"The sign will come, and the tale will come, Princess&mdash;all
in good time will it surely come," was the
answer; and then Wyborga gathered the three around
her and told them of many things&mdash;of wonders from
far lands, of the birds' talk and the beasts' talk, and
things that men know nothing of; and while they
talked there came a blowing of horns, and the King
rode by on the chase, and reined his horse and spoke
to the wise woman with kind, good humor.</p>

<p>"Greeting, Wyborga," he said. "Our watch fires
are piled, but they are unlighted; our warders watch,
but give no alarm; our swords are keen, but they sing
no song. Surely thy wisdom was at fault when thou
didst prophesy evil for the land."</p>

<p>"Art thou so impatient for the evil to come, O
King?" she answered sadly. "It will come sure, if
it comes slow. God moves not quickly."</p>

<p>"God?" answered the King lightly. "Why,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>Wyborga, we have many gods, of whom Odin and
Thor are the mightiest&mdash;which of them dost thou speak
of? They move fast enough for me, for they ride the
storm wind so swiftly that all the storm sisters are left
far behind in their path. Which god do you speak
of, Wyborga?"</p>

<p>Then Wyborga stooped, and with the end of her
wand which she used to aid her steps she marked on
the ground, and the marks that she made formed a
cross.</p>

<p>"The God of this sign, O King," she said. And at
that the King shook his head, and thought with pity
that surely poor old Wyborga was mad, for of all the
gods of the Northland was there none whose sign was
a cross.</p>

<p>"Now, good mother," he said aloud, "I understand
not thy sign. Canst thou give me no other by which
I shall know when the time is near?"</p>

<p>Then Wyborga bent her head in thought, and was
silent for a space, and after that she looked up and
spoke, and said to the King&mdash;</p>

<p>"So be it. I will give you one sign, and when you
see that, then be sure that soon the sword shall sing the
death song in the land."</p>

<p>"Good!" cried the King. "Give me this sign."</p>

<p>Then Wyborga pointed to where Wulnoth stood
near, and she said&mdash;</p>

<p>"This is the sign, O King. When this boy treads
the birds' road, then be sure that the time has come."
And at that the King laughed aloud.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>
<p>"Now, by my beard," he said, "if that were possible,
then would I do well to slay Wulnoth, son of
Cerdic, and so the evil should never come. But no
mortal foot has trodden the birds' road yet, and none
ever shall, so let Wulnoth live, and let the evil be far
off; and now greeting, mother."</p>

<p>"Greeting, King," she answered, and Wulnoth and
the Prince cried "Skoal" to the King, and Edgiva
kissed her hand to him, and so Hardacnute and his
men rode on, laughing to themselves; for how could
old Wyborga speak of any treading the birds' road
without wings? and where was there a man in the
world winged like the eagle or raven?</p>

<p>And Wulnoth and the Prince and Edgiva went
back to the hall, and they wondered also, pondering
over the strange things spoken by Wyborga the Wise.</p>

<p>And yet that which the wise woman spoke came
to pass, and this was the manner of its coming. There
was in the hall of King Hardacnute a young noble
of Denmark, a dark, black-haired young holda, who had
journeyed across the mountains seeking adventure, as
he said, and had been well received and given an honorable
place by the King, in spite of the warnings of
his jarls, and especially of old Hald.</p>

<p>"A viper stings sooner or later," said the Constable,
"and a Dane plays false. Kill the stranger or
send him on, for we want no spying Haco here."</p>

<p>But the King answered that a man's hall must
ever be open to the wanderer, and that it did not become
brave men to be inhospitable; and so this youth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>whose name was Osbert, tarried in Lethra&mdash;a big,
bragging young giant, and over fond of the drink
horn.</p>

<p>Now, one day, as Wulnoth stood guarding the
couch of Edgiva, for she had fallen asleep in the shade
of the courtyard, lo, there came Osbert the Dane striding
along, all flushed with wine. Now, Osbert looked
upon Wulnoth with scorn, because he was a boy and
a thrall, and also because he knew that his father
had smitten Berwulf with his own axe in the hall of
Tholk, son of Cerdic&mdash;for Osbert was of the blood of
Berwulf.</p>

<p>Therefore, seeing Edgiva sleeping there and
guarded by Wulnoth, Osbert thought to make mock of
the boy, and he strode up and seized Edgiva and kissed
her, so that she cried out partly in fear and partly in
anger at being so rudely aroused; and Wulnoth started
forward, and presented his spear, and cried fiercely&mdash;</p>

<p>"Set down the Lady Edgiva instantly, thou rude
Dane, or I will pierce thee with this spear."</p>

<p>Then did Osbert place the Princess down, and he
drew his heavy sword, and swung his shield from his
back to his arm, and he laughed right scornfully.</p>

<p>"Thou wilt pierce me, thou carl. That will we
see," and with that he made at Wulnoth fiercely.</p>

<p>But Hald the Constable was nigh, and when he
heard the signs of strife he seized his great sword and
strode into the courtyard, and struck the weapons apart,
and demanded sternly how it came that any dared to
fight in the courtyard of the King.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>
<p>"This dog insulted me," cried the Dane fiercely,
"and for it, by Thor, he shall die!"</p>

<p>"By Thor, he shall not die!" answered Hald, "until
we know the truth of this business; but, for that
matter, thou mightest find it hard to slay him, Dane."</p>

<p>So Wulnoth told how he came to have a quarrel
with Osbert, and the brow of Hald grew dark when
he heard of the slight to Edgiva, who now stood weeping,
and he commanded the Dane to be carried before
Hardacnute, that the King might say his pleasure.</p>

<p>And when the King heard, he said sternly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Osbert, stranger amongst us, hadst thou been
one of my people, I would surely have had thy head
smitten off. But thou art a stranger, and one who has
been my guest, and I may not do this thing. Yet this
I will do. Thy arms shall be taken from thee and
broken as the arms of a nithing, and thou shalt be
scourged with rods, a blow for every tear that the Lady
Edgiva has shed, and thou shalt be driven from my
lands; and if thou comest here again, then thou shalt
be slain."</p>

<p>And the King's word was obeyed, and the Dane's
weapons were broken, and he was scourged with rods,
a blow for each tear that the Princess had shed; and
when the scourging was ended the King bade him begone
as he valued his life.</p>

<p>And Osbert, smarting with the beating, and mad
with rage, spoke boldly and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Perchance this scourging I deserve, O King, for
letting the wine horn make me into a weakling; yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>bitter shall be the price paid for it, O King. For each
blow of the rod blood shall flow, and the sword
sing its song. Now I go as thou hast said, for indeed
I could not remain longer; but be sure that thou wilt
hear of me again, ere long, O King, and our greeting
will be brief."</p>

<p>But the King laughed scornfully. "Big words
from an angry boy," he said. "Get thee gone while
thou art safe." And Osbert turned and went.</p>

<p>And a few days after that, Wulnoth and Guthred
and Edgiva went to the top of the great Raven Rock,
from whence they could see for many a mile, and at the
foot of which the sea fretted and chafed and broke itself
into foam at the high tide; and here they sat watching
the sea-birds circle as they trod the birds' road down to
the water, and up to the crags where their nests were
built.</p>

<p>Not a sign of living man was there; all was
peaceful and calm; and Wulnoth lay on the ground,
watching the Princess, who had strayed to gather wild
blossoms, whilst Guthred cautiously bent over the
height, seeking to steal the eggs from a seamew's nest.</p>

<p>And while thus they were all serene and safe, suddenly
a shadow fell upon Wulnoth, and a dark face
looked down upon him, and a strong hand seized him,
and the voice of Osbert hissed in his ear&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thou dog of a Saxon thrall&mdash;die!"</p>

<p>And then came the sharp bitter bite of a knife in
the side, and a red mist rose before Wulnoth's eyes,
and a wicked laugh echoed in his ear.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>
<p>And it seemed as though he were sinking into the
storm-land, when a sound called his spirit back, and
that sound was the scream of the Princess Edgiva.
He heard also Guthred shout, and he heard Osbert
cry&mdash;</p>

<p>"Greeting to thee, Prince. Yonder lies thy thrall
friend slain, and here is the Princess, thy sister. Go
and tell thy father&mdash;for this I spare thy life&mdash;that
I have sent her to the storm-land by the birds' road."</p>

<p>Then Wulnoth managed to stagger to his feet; and
he saw,&mdash;oh, the horror of it,&mdash;he saw that nithing lift
Edgiva the Beautiful high in the air, and send her over
the Raven Rock into the angry sea so far below; and he
uttered a great cry, and all his strength seemed to come
back, so that he picked up his spear and hurled it, and
it smote Osbert a fierce blow in the shoulder, making
him cry out and turn and flee, plucking out the weapon
and casting it aside as he went.</p>

<p>"Run, run," cried Wulnoth to Guthred. "Run so
that the grass feels not thy touch. Nay, not after
that nithing," as the Prince was starting after the
wounded Osbert. "We have more to think of than him.
Run to the shore and bid them launch a boat and come
to the aid of Edgiva. I go to her now."</p>

<p>"Alas, how canst thou, my friend?" cried Guthred.
"The way to the water is long and the path hard;
and even if she lives now she will have died ere thou
canst reach her."</p>

<p>"The way is short and the path easy," cried Wulnoth,
as he cast off his tunic. "Tell thy father, my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>lord the King, that Wyborga's words have come true,
for I go by the birds' road."</p>

<p>And with that he stood on the verge of the mighty
Raven Rock, and he saw far below, a gleam of gold
in the water, as when the salmon play in the sunlit
waves; and then, while Guthred stood in wonder and
silence, he dived straight and true, speeding to the
perishing Edgiva along the birds' road.</p>

<p>And this is how Osbert the Dane brought trouble
into the land, and how Wulnoth fulfilled the prophecy
of Wyborga the Wise.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

<small><em>The Coming of Hungwar and Hubba</em></small></h2>


<p>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_049.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">D</span>own into the angry waves
went Wulnoth, treading the
birds' road; for only thus
could he hope to reach Edgiva
in time to save her.
Down he went, and he smote
the waves and sank, even to
the very bottom of the depths,
while the surges roared and
thundered above him.</p>

<p>Weak was he from loss of blood and sore pain,
for the knife of Osbert the Dane had bitten deeply;
but strong was he with his devotion for Edgiva, and
the strength overcame the weakness.</p>

<p>Down, down he went; then he rose and came to
the surface and shook the water from his eyes and
glanced around; and there, floating away now on
the ebbing tide, her golden hair rising and falling
on the waves, he saw the jewel of Lethra, the Princess
Edgiva.</p>

<p>Then, cleaving the waves with strong arms, though
every stroke left a crimson stain behind it, Wulnoth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>pressed forward, swift as the sturgeon takes its way.
His eyes were fixed upon the fair little face, which was
now slowly sinking beneath the waves; and he gave a
loud cry and leaped sheer out of the water, as the salmon
leaps when it climbs the falls, and his right hand
snatched at her and lifted her above the water again;
and then the heart of Wulnoth was very glad, for he
felt that once more he should save Edgiva.</p>

<p>And now back to the land he turned and on he
swam, but the tide ran fierce, and his blood oozed fast,
and the way was long, and he was faint and could
swim no more. So he turned on his back and floated,
letting Edgiva's golden, crowned head rest on his
bosom; and so he stayed while the sea-birds flew overhead
and called to him, bidding him be of good cheer,
for that help was coming.</p>

<p>And help was coming indeed; for the Prince had
run swift as the arrow flies and had cried to Hald the
Constable; and now one of the King's boats was coming
over the waves, and strong arms were at the oars,
while Hald stood shading his eyes and crying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Holloa! Holloa! Wulnoth son of Cerdic!
Holloa!"</p>

<p>And Wulnoth heard as one who hears a sound from
afar, when sleep presses upon his eyes; and he tried
to answer but his voice was gone. But the sea-birds
aided him, for they gathered over his head, screaming
shrilly; and when Hald saw that, he knew that thither
he must go, and he gave order and the boat sped on
and came to the spot, and there floated Wulnoth, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>Edgiva's head pillowed on his heart, and both with
their eyes closed as in their last sleep.</p>

<p>Strong but tender hands lifted them in, and strong
hands urged the boat back; and they were taken to the
King's hall and tended by the Queen herself; for Queen
Wulfreda was skilled in healing. And search was made
through the land for the nithing who had done this
thing; yet, though they rode throughout all the King's
borders, they found no trace of Osbert the Dane.</p>

<p>And Wyborga the Wise also came, bringing medicines
of her own; and so soon the sick ones awoke
from their slumber, and Wulnoth was commanded to
come before the King.</p>

<p>And there, in the great hall, with all the jarls
around him, the King praised Wulnoth, and asked him
what he would choose as his gift, and said that now he
would take the thrall's collar from his neck.</p>

<p>But Wulnoth made answer, and his voice was low
and sad, and he said that the collar should not be taken
from his neck, but that instead of gifts he should be
scourged, because he, being armed, and the Princess's
watcher, had suffered harm to come to her.</p>

<p>"Not honor, but disgrace, do I deserve, O King,"
he said; "for I have proved myself a false watcher."</p>

<p>"Now, that may not be," cried the King, "for none
would have dared to tread the birds' road as thou hast
done." But to that Hald said&mdash;</p>

<p>"There is reason in the boy's words, O King.
Therefore let it be as he says; but for his reward take
the collar from his father's neck, and give Cerdic five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>hides of good land, so that he shall be noble." And
all the redesmen said that the Constable's words were
good words and that it was a wise saying.</p>

<p>So the King commanded that Cerdic should be
given five hides of good land and that the thrall collar
should be taken from his neck; and then Reinbaldus
the scald made a song and sang it in the great hall
while the King feasted, and this was the song he sang&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">And skoal to Edgiva.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Such was the song which Reinbaldus sang; and
the soldiers and the people said it was a fair song and
a true song, and that Wulnoth was worthy of honor.
And they called the Raven's Rock "Wulnoth's Road,"
because of the great leap which he took thence into the
swan bath to rescue Edgiva.</p>

<p>Yet still Wulnoth himself felt darkened, for he reflected
that he, being the Princess's watcher, ought to
have been standing on guard rather than lying there
taking his ease so that Osbert the Dane could come
upon them; and though many strove to banish such
thoughts from his mind, old Hald said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let be. The boy will be all the better for thinking
on it. I will warrant me he will never now be found
asleep at his post, let the watch be as long as it will."</p>

<p>But now King Hardacnute was indeed grave, for
here was Wyborga's prophecy fulfilled, and he looked
for the foe to come.</p>

<p>But no enemy came, no, not for a week, nor two,
nor a full month; and then, one morning, just as the
King was beginning to think that it was but a fable after
all, far out on the Westarweg six long ships appeared,
each with its huge sail, each with its long pennon, each
with its sides bright with the long rows of shields hung
over the bulwarks, each propelled by banks of long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>oars; and from the foremost one floated a mighty banner
with a great black raven upon it, so that all might
know that these were ships of the sea-kings and pirates,
lords from Juteland and Denmark.</p>

<p>"Now," said old Hald, as he stood on the tower
and gazed seaward long and hard, "if these be the
ships of Regner Lodbrok, the son of Sigurd, it will be
a hard fight and a long that we shall have; for of all
the sea-kings that carry fire and sword, there is none
so mighty as the dragon slayer."</p>

<p>"Methinks 't is the banner of the son of Sigurd,"
said the King, who stood beside him, and old Hald
nodded.</p>

<p>"By land or by sea, O King?" he asked. And the
King mused&mdash;</p>

<p>"By sea if it would save the land from blood," he
said, "but I fear it will not. My word is, meet them
on land."</p>

<p>"And ere they land, every ship that Lethra possesses
will be in flames," answered Hald. "If we must
lose our ships, better to man them and lose them in the
man's game than to sit like sheep and see them burn."
And the King answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"Be it so."</p>

<p>So the war horns sounded, and the beacons blazed,
and all men came trooping in, and the women and children
gathered in the King's hall, for there alone might be
found safety for them. And all the cattle were driven
into the courtyard, or else turned loose in the deep
forest where the foe would not be likely to find them.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>
<p>"Guthred, my friend and brother," said Wulnoth,
as he stood by the side of the Prince, "so at last we are
really to see the man's game played and to take part
in it! Is this Regner Lodbrok so mighty, then?"</p>

<p>"I have heard my father say that there lives no
greater warrior, and that though he is terrible in battle
he is just and loves brave men, and not cruel like some&mdash;not
like his two sons, Hungwar and Hubba; for
where they go there is the cry of the woman and the
child, and the scream of the tortured one. Thou knowest
that it was Regner Lodbrok who slew the dragon?"</p>

<p>"Nay," answered Wulnoth. "I know not the
story. Tell it to me, I pray."</p>

<p>"This is how the scalds have it," answered the
Prince. "You must know that this Regner Lodbrok,
the son of Sigurd, loved a lady named Thora, who was
the fairest woman who ever lived&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not fairer than our Edgiva," cried Wulnoth jealously,
and the Prince smiled.</p>

<p>"That I cannot say, seeing that Edgiva my sister
is but a child, and this lady was a woman. But be that
as it may. A warlock took the Lady Thora and carried
her away, and left her guarded by a fiery dragon&mdash;a
dreadful monster whom no man could overcome
because it belched out flames at them. But Regner
Lodbrok<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> heard of this, and he swore by Thor that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>would slay the monster and free the Lady Thora. So he
took skins of oxen, and thereof he made clothing to
cover all his body, from the feet to the neck, and thus
covered he went to the cave and rushed at the dragon.
The monster spat fire at him, but Regner Lodbrok held
his shield before his face, and the flames scorched the
skins but harmed not him, and he buried his sword in
the dragon's heart and slew him, and freed the Lady
Thora and carried her back with him."</p>

<p>"How brave of him!" cried Wulnoth. "Surely
't was a man's deed, and if such a foe is coming, thou
and I, O Prince, shall see some great deeds done
to-day."</p>

<p>"We may, Wulnoth, my friend," answered Guthred.
"But remember what Wyborga the Wise has
said. In this battle the King, my father, is to be slain,
and I am to become a slave," and at that Wulnoth had
no word to say, for the grief of it was too much for
him.</p>

<p>"Wulnoth," the Prince went on sadly, "if this thing
is true, will you promise not to forget me? And if you
may, afterwards come and seek me out and aid me.
Wulnoth, we have been friends and brothers, will you
promise me this?"</p>

<p>"That will I promise, Guthred," answered Wulnoth.
"As soon as my trust to Edgiva is over, I will
come."</p>

<p>"Poor Edgiva," sighed the Prince. "I wonder
what fate will be in store for her."</p>

<p>Now, while the boys talked, all was hurry and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>bustle, and Hald went to the ships with the sailors, and
King Hardacnute gathered the army on the shore, and
Cerdic, and Hith, and Æthelmar, and others went into
the hold to be able to succor the rest, should they
have to flee, and then the war horns blew again, and
the ships went to sea to meet the foe.</p>

<p>And when they neared each other, old Hald, standing
in the prow, called across the water and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Greeting, strangers! Sea-kings and pirates I
trow ye are, and your message is war; yet tell us whom
we war against lest we shame you by saying ye are
nameless men."</p>

<p>Then a great warrior, yet a young man, standing
in the poop of one of the foremost of the foe ships,
laughed and replied&mdash;</p>

<p>"Little care we what you call us, warrior, yet know
that we are the sons of Regner, called Lodbrok, Hungwar
and Hubba, and we come to avenge injury done to
Osbert the Dane. We come to war against Hardacnute
for sheltering a thrall of Berwulf's named Cerdic
and his family; and we come to carry away a fair child
Edgiva, that when she is maiden grown she may mate
with the best of the sea-kings' warriors. Now dost thou
yield?"</p>

<p>"Thus do I yield, you wolves of Denmark," replied
Hald, hurling his spear, but Hungwar caught it
on his shield, and then the battle commenced.</p>

<p>Now, we have no time to talk long of that battle,
for we have to follow the song of Wulnoth; but it was
a brave and fierce one, when many hero deeds were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>done, and when the sword sang its death-song again
and again. Yet in the end the ships of Hardacnute
were destroyed and his sailors perished, and the Danes
ran their own ships aground, and swarmed out to meet
the forces of Hardacnute on land.</p>

<p>And there, on land, a mighty war was waged, and
many heroes fell; yet still the victory was with the
Danes, and the men of Lethra were driven back, leaving
many slain on the seashore.</p>

<p>Now while this battle was raging, Wulnoth was
in the King's courtyard, when a man touched him
on the arm; and the man was big and brawny and
shaggy like some wild berserker, and this man said to
Wulnoth&mdash;</p>

<p>"Are you Wulnoth, the watcher of the Princess?"
and to this Wulnoth answered that he was.</p>

<p>"Then," said the man, "I have a message for thee,
O Wulnoth," and Wulnoth asked whom the message
was from.</p>

<p>"It is from Wyborga the Wise," answered the
stranger, "and thus she says: 'Fire and sword are
come, O Wulnoth, and by to-night will Edgiva be without
father or mother. Now, therefore, bring her to me,
and I will shelter her in safety, for Hungwar the Dane
has sworn to carry her off and to make her his slave
child. If my words are wrong, then can you have her
back; but if they are right, then will the King know
that his daughter is spared the fate which shall befall
his son.'"</p>

<p>Now, when Wulnoth heard this, he sped to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>Queen, and he told her all the truth. And Wulfreda
answered and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, if these words are true, and if the King my
husband perish, then shall I rejoice to have the death-song
sung to me also; and if that be so, then shall it be
well that Edgiva has a friend to aid her. Therefore,
take her to Wyborga, Wulnoth."</p>

<p>So Wulnoth and Guthred took Edgiva the Beautiful,
and carried her away into the forest and gave her
to Wyborga, and Wyborga said that they had done
well. And then said Wulnoth&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why should not Guthred tarry here also, good
mother, so that he will be safe?"</p>

<p>But Wyborga shook her head.</p>

<p>"Guthred must go back," she said, "for so the lines
of his runes run. But let Guthred be of good cheer and
brave heart, for he shall have a kingdom and a name
in the end, and ye three shall meet again."</p>

<p>"When shall we meet?" cried Guthred. And for
answer Wyborga again drew the cross on the ground
and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"When you all understand this, then shall you
meet, and then shall you be united."</p>

<p>And that was all she could say. So Wulnoth and
Guthred hurried back, for the blood was hot in Wulnoth's
veins, and he longed to be in the man's game.
And they got back to the hall just as King Hardacnute's
men were being driven in, and there they saw the
brothers Hungwar and Hubba, the sons of Regner,
mighty warriors, with long black moustachios and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>sweeping hair, and arms like the stout branches of an
oak.</p>

<p>And also there did Wulnoth see Osbert the Dane,
and he cried to him in a voice that rang over the din
of the fight&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hi, there! Greeting to you, Osbert, nithing and
attacker of little children. Come hither, for I have a
greeting for thee, unless thou dost still fear my
spear."</p>

<p>"By Thor's hammer!" growled Hungwar as he
heard this. "Thou must answer this, Osbert. Go thou,
whilst we rest a space, and silence that wolf cub." But
Osbert looked as though he liked not his task.</p>

<p>Still he could not escape, and he advanced towards
the keep; and Wulnoth sprang from the wall and ran to
meet him.</p>

<p>"Now, now, Osbert," he cried, "never have I slain
a man yet, but thou wilt do for a start!" And Osbert
answered with a thrust of his spear.</p>

<p>But Wulnoth caught it on his shield and turned it
aside, and then he struck once, and once only, and the
blow pierced through shield and arm behind it, and
Osbert gave a bitter cry and fell.</p>

<p>"Mercy! mercy!" he cried, and the Danes howled
with anger. But the wild war madness was in Wulnoth's
blood now, and he drew his sword and plunged
it into the nithing's throat, crying out, "So shall all
nithings and Danish pirates perish!"</p>

<p>"By Troth!" cried Hubba, "that is a gamesome
young wolf. We must have him alive." But Wulnoth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>had fled back, and was let into the hold by the men, who
cried "Skoal" to him.</p>

<p>And then did the man's game begin again, and
still the fight was with the vikings. And Cerdic was
slain by a sling stone, and one after another of the King's
champions went to the storm-world, and the flames
burst from the roofs, and the cries of the women sounded
on the air, for the vikings slew and spared none.</p>

<p>In the courtyard Wulfreda stood by her husband's
side and shielded him while he fought, and around him
lay a ring of Danish slain. But he fell at last, and
Hubba himself smote off his head.</p>

<p>"This is the King's son!" cried Hungwar, seizing
Guthred. "I have an oath as regards this boy and his
sister. They shall be thralls in my castle." But to that
Guthred answered boldly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thou Danish pirate, though thou hast me in thy
power, thou shalt never have my sister, for she is beyond
thy reach."</p>

<p>"That we will see," answered Hungwar. "Bind
this boy with chains, and take him to my long
ship."</p>

<p>Then he caught sight of Wulnoth, who had fought
as a man fights and was sore wounded, and he cried
aloud&mdash;</p>

<p>"By my beard, but 't is our little warrior wolf!&mdash;a
boy, but thou must be of us. Now, methinks, thou art
the son of that Cerdic that we came to seek, for thou
hast Saxon blood in thee I will swear, and thou hast
thrall collar on. But thou art a man and we will spare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>thee, and thou shalt be my servant. What dost thou
say to that?"</p>

<p>"No servant of thine will I be, thou pirate of Denmark!"
cried Wulnoth. "Thou art a champion and a
sea-king, and I but a boy and a thrall, and only one of a
few left of all Lethra's soldiers, yet thus and thus do
I answer thee." And with that he rushed at the great
Dane, and smote twice with his broken sword; and
the first blow gashed Hungwar's brow, and the second
pierced his arm, so that the champion of Denmark
reeled backwards and would have fallen but that a
soldier smote Wulnoth down with his axe, so that they
thought him slain.</p>

<p>Then did the Danes gather together all the treasure
of Lethra for their plunder, and they slew all, man,
woman, and child, as many as they found, and they set
fire to each house and hall, and spread the red flames
through the land; and then they sailed away, and of
all the people they took only some fair maids and the
Prince, who Hungwar had sworn should live as a
thrall, for the blows which Hardacnute had caused to
be laid upon the back of Osbert the Dane.</p>

<p>Now, this is how the words of Wyborga the Wise
came true, and Hungwar and Hubba carried fire and
sword through the land of Lethra and took Guthred
the Prince prisoner back to Denmark when they went
away.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

<small><em>Of Wulnoth's Schooling</em></small></h2>


<p>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_063.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">W</span>hen Wulnoth opened his
eyes again he was in a cool
cave, through the entrance
of which he could see the
green glades of the forest,
and there before him sat
Wyborga the Wise, while
Princess Edgiva played near
by with a little wild fawn.</p>

<p>He raised himself on his
elbow and glanced around in wonder, hardly able to
remember anything of what had gone beside; and
Wyborga rose and brought him a cooling drink, saying
gently&mdash;</p>

<p>"So thou art better, Wulnoth! For many days
has thy spirit hovered between life and death, but thou
hast turned back, as I knew thou wouldst&mdash;for thy
work is before thee, and thou must help to do great
things."</p>

<p>"What things must I do, O mother?" he asked.
And Wyborga took up her favorite symbol again&mdash;a
little wooden cross&mdash;and planted it in the earth.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>
<p>"So must thou help to plant this in another land,
Wulnoth," she said. And he shook his head somewhat
impatiently.</p>

<p>"Oh, good mother, I am weary of symbols and dark
sayings. Tell me in plain words, for as for thy cross,
I can make nothing of it."</p>

<p>"Not yet, Wulnoth. The time is not yet," she
said. "But now thou must rest and grow strong, for
there is much to do."</p>

<p>"And how went the fight after I was struck
down?" he asked. "Methinks there was little fighting
left to do."</p>

<p>"All too little," she answered. "Of all in Lethra,
the Danes left not one alive saving only a few who
escaped to the woods. Thy father and mother, and the
King and Queen, and Hald and all the mighty ones have
perished, and Lethra is ruin and ashes and desolation
to-day. Such is the work of Hungwar and Hubba."</p>

<p>"Make me strong, O mother! make me strong if
thou hast any skill!" cried Wulnoth. "For I will follow
those pirates to the end of the world, if need be,
and I will bring again Guthred, the Prince, from
captivity."</p>

<p>"Not yet, Wulnoth. Thou hast much to learn,
and Guthred has much to learn, ere ye two meet again,
for so I read your lives. Now sleep, and when thou
awakest, I will tell thee what there is to be done
first."</p>

<p>So Wulnoth slept; and for a day and night and
half a second day, he opened not his eyes. But then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>when he awoke he felt strong again, and he rose and
said to Wyborga, who sat in the entrance of the cave&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good mother, I am strong, and I thank thee.
Didst thou come and search me out?"</p>

<p>"I sent one to do it, Wulnoth," she answered.
"One who found thee nigh to death and bore thee hither
to me."</p>

<p>"And thou hast cured me! Now, mother, I am, as
thou knowest, the watcher of the Princess, and though
she has no realm to come to now, methinks she is still
my Princess, and I must do my work. But then I am
sworn to seek my friend the Prince. Now both I cannot
do; therefore give me thy rede and tell me what to do."</p>

<p>"Wulnoth," answered the wise woman, "the Princess
is very fair, and as she grows older there will be
none so fair." And Wulnoth answered that it was so.</p>

<p>"Moreover, Wulnoth," said Wyborga, "methinks
thou dost love her very much." And again he
answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"She is my Princess, and I would give every drop
of my blood for her."</p>

<p>"Ay, truly, and methinks the Princess is fond of
thee. Now, thrones and power are small things. How
wouldst thou like to give up all such thoughts, Wulnoth,
and to abide here, and perchance when Edgiva is maid
grown, to take her for thy wife?" and Wyborga looked
gravely at Wulnoth.</p>

<p>But Cerdic's son drew himself up, and he answered
quickly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, mother, that is a hard question, for of itself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>there would be no better thing than to live in peace
beneath the green wood with Edgiva for my wife. But
this may not be. For think, is it meet for a king's
daughter to live her life like savage maiden? and is it
right for a thrall, and a thrall's son, to ask a princess to
be his mate? And is it meet that I should do this thing,
even if I might, and forget my oath to the Prince, her
brother? No, mother, this thing may not be."</p>

<p>Then Wyborga smiled and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thou hast answered well, Wulnoth, and this thing
I said but to prove thee. Know if thou hadst yielded
still it would never have been. But listen to my words.
Thou canst not seek the Prince yet, for thou wilt have
far to go, and thou wilt have to go amongst the champions
of the earth. Thou must learn much first, Wulnoth,
and be patient in thy learning."</p>

<p>Then answered Wulnoth and said, "What must
I learn, mother, and who shall be my schoolmaster?"</p>

<p>So Wyborga went to the door and called softly, and
a shadow fell before the entrance of the cave, and there
entered the wild-looking man who had come to Wulnoth
on the day of the battle.</p>

<p>"Wulnoth," he said, "I am Osth the berserker and
the giant,"&mdash;and truly he was a gigantic man,&mdash;"and
Wyborga the Wise has bidden me to teach thee if thou
wilt be taught; but the time will be long and the work
hard, for he who would gain experience must gain it
at hard cost, and he who would conquer others must
conquer self."</p>

<p>Then said Wulnoth, "For how long must I learn,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>Osth?" and the berserker replied, "Until thou art
perfect."</p>

<p>Then did Edgiva come to Wulnoth and place her
arms round his neck, and call him her good Wulnoth,
and bid him go; and Wyborga promised that each new
moon he should come and see them in the cave. So
Wulnoth consented and went away with Osth into the
high mountain, along the goats' road, which is hard to
climb and weary to walk.</p>

<p>And there in a cave the boy dwelt with the wild
man, and he drank no wine nor milk, but only the clear
water of the stream. And he ate wild fruit and goat's
flesh; and each morning Osth set him to roll great
stones up the hill, and as fast as he got them to the
top they rolled down again, until at length he cried in
anger&mdash;</p>

<p>"Of what use is this, Osth? The stones will not
remain at the top, and if they did they are no use there,"
but to that Osth only grunted, and said he that would
succeed must labor.</p>

<p>"It shall not be my fault if I do not succeed,"
thought Wulnoth, and he set to work again, and rolled
the stones all day long though he could not see any use
in it, until one day the giant said to him&mdash;</p>

<p>"Seest thou yon oak tree, Wulnoth? Canst pull
off a branch at one wrench?"</p>

<p>"Neither I nor any man could do that," answered
Wulnoth; but the berserker said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Try."</p>

<p>So Wulnoth went to the oak, and he took a firm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>grip on a branch and pulled, and lo, the branch came
away.</p>

<p>"Whence have I got this strength?" cried the
youth in wonder. And the giant answered, "Rolling
stones. Each stone added a little, and each little joined
the rest, until thou canst do this. Thou must learn
another lesson now."</p>

<p>So Osth set him to leap the precipices and to descend
from point to point, until he was as surefooted as
the goat, and then one day he bade him strip and
wrestle.</p>

<p>Now Wulnoth wrestled hard, but he could not
throw the giant, and each time the giant threw him so
that he lost heart, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"What use wrestling with thee, O Osth? I shall
never conquer thee." But the giant answered with a
grunt&mdash;</p>

<p>"He who would succeed must labor," and again
Wulnoth was silenced.</p>

<p>And one day there came a bear, and the giant
said, "Canst wrestle with yonder honey-finder, Wulnoth?"</p>

<p>"Nay," said Wulnoth. "Neither can any man."
But Osth answered, "Go and try."</p>

<p>So Wulnoth went to the bear, and the honey-finder
rose up and opened wide his paws. But Wulnoth took
a good grip and squeezed his ribs, and threw him down,
so that the honey-finder got up and ran off grunting.
And Wulnoth said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Whence have I got this cunning?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>
<p>"Through being thrown by me," answered Osth.
"Thou must learn another lesson now."</p>

<p>And he set him pulling against himself, until at
length he could take a bullock by the horns and pull
against it, and cast it over the hill, and so, day by day,
did the giant make him work until his bones ached and
his limbs grew weary, but he grew strong and mighty,
and could run all day and not stop, and climb the
steepest hill, and leap the widest chasm, and wield
a club in either hand, and shatter a rock with every
blow; and after each task in which he succeeded the
giant laughed and grunted, and said that it was well.</p>

<p>And at every full moon Wulnoth went down to see
Wyborga and Edgiva, and it seemed to him that Edgiva
grew more and more in grace each time he saw her,
until he cried to Wyborga&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, Wyborga, tell me what this thing does mean!
A few months ago and Edgiva was a child, and now she
is a woman, and so beautiful that it melts the heart to
look at her."</p>

<p>Then did Wyborga laugh and answer&mdash;</p>

<p>"The riddle is not hard, Wulnoth. It is thus: For
every moon that thou hast been yonder a year has sped.
Canst thou not see that thou art a man?"</p>

<p>"I never thought of that, for the giant has kept
me so busy," he answered. "I have been seven months
with him."</p>

<p>"Seven years," answered Wyborga. "So swiftly
has time flown. Thou art twenty-four, and Edgiva is
fifteen now."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>
<p>But then did Wulnoth look wroth, and he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"This is all well, mother, but what of my promise?
I said that I would seek out my friend, and here I have
tarried playing for seven years, and he is a slave. I
have somewhat to settle with the sons of Regner, and
seven years have been wasted."</p>

<p>"Not wasted," answered Wyborga. "Thou art
now fitted for thy work. And now, before thou dost
start, go and talk with Edgiva, for she has been learning
too, and she now knows the wonder tale of which I
spoke, and it has made darkness light, and sorrow has
become joy, and weakness strength with her."</p>

<p>So Wulnoth went to Edgiva and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"My Princess, Wyborga has sent me to talk with
you, that I may hear the story which she says you
know. Though before she said that in another land
alone I should hear it."</p>

<p>"Wulnoth," answered Edgiva gently, "there is
hearing with the ears, and hearing with the heart; and
which hearing thine will be I know not yet. But sit
down beside me and listen to my story."</p>

<p>So Wulnoth obeyed, and Edgiva told him her story,
and it was such a story as he had never thought of.
For she told him how the gods of the North were false
gods, and how there was but one true God Who made
all things. And she told how this God had sent His
Son, who was the Lord Christ, and the Bretwalda of all
angels; and how men had put Him to death on the
cross, and crowned Him with thorns, and how for His
love He had suffered and not destroyed them. And she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>spoke of how His subjects must be lowly and gentle and
forgiving and meek, until at last Wulnoth jumped up
and cried in impatience&mdash;</p>

<p>"What story is this you tell me, O Edgiva the
Beautiful? This is a tale for nithings and cowards!
What man would stand and be buffeted and spat upon
if his hand could grasp a good sword and strike a good
blow? I like not the tale, and I like not Wyborga for
telling it to thee. The gods of our Northland were men
truly, and did heroes' deeds; but as for this Lord of
thine, methinks he deserved to die for the nithing and
the coward that He was. Put such things away, Edgiva.
I go to search for thy brother. I have sworn, and I
must fulfil; and thou canst either tarry here, or, if thou
wilt come with me, I will be thy servant and thrall."</p>

<p>But Edgiva shook her head. "I want not servant
or thrall, Wulnoth," she said. And he asked&mdash;</p>

<p>"Then what dost thou want, Edgiva?"</p>

<p>"That I may not tell thee until thine own heart finds
out, and thou wilt never truly find out until thou dost
hear the wonder tale."</p>

<p>"I have just heard it," answered Wulnoth, "and I
have told thee that I like it not. Fit for women and
nithings perhaps, but for men and heroes it is an idle
story. Edgiva, I must go to seek thy brother."</p>

<p>"That I know, Wulnoth," she said. "May fortune
speed thy seeking. Now farewell."</p>

<p>"But what wilt thou do?" he cried. "Wilt thou
tarry here with Wyborga?"</p>

<p>"I shall do as my Lord wills," she answered. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>at that Wulnoth was angry, for who was this whom
Edgiva called Lord? What lover had sought her in
the woodlands, he wondered.</p>

<p>He strode away in wrath and pain, but then he
thought that after all he had no right to be angry, for
he was but a born thrall, and Edgiva was a princess.</p>

<p>Still, in those dark moments he knew that he loved
her, and he felt that he must go back and tell her, and
beg her to let him be her servant for ever.</p>

<p>So back, through the moonlight, Wulnoth went to
the cave and called to Wyborga and to Edgiva, but no
answer came. Then he entered and looked around, and
no one was there!</p>

<p>He went into the woods and cried aloud, but only
the echoes answered, and the night owl cried, and then he
sat down and wept, for he thought that indeed Edgiva
had gone to her Lord, and that he would see her no more.</p>

<p>And then he went back to the cave, and there was
a strange stillness in the place, as though it mourned
that Edgiva had gone&mdash;as though in going she had
taken all life and light with her; and he sat down and
wept, and cried her name aloud, and said that he loved
her and would surely die now; and then he looked up
and he saw Wyborga some way off in the wood, and
she called to him and spoke&mdash;</p>

<p>"Listen, Wulnoth," she said. "The time for work
is now, and you must wander forth to seek for Guthred.
As for Edgiva, she has gone where her Lord wills, and
some day you will meet her again, when you have fulfilled
your task."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>
<p>"My task!" he cried. "What task is that, Wyborga?
To find the Prince?"</p>

<p>"Nay, more than that," she replied. "You have
said that the Lord Christ is weakling and nithing.
Now, therefore, go and search in the world, and when
you have found the strongest and the noblest, and the
bravest of all Lords, then know that you will see Edgiva
again, and that your task will be nearly done."</p>

<p>"But, Wyborga!" he cried. But she had gone&mdash;the
darkness of the forest had swallowed her up, and
he was alone.</p>

<p>He went back to the giant's cave, but Osth was
gone also, and he was alone&mdash;alone without a single
friend, not knowing whither to go to search for Guthred,
nor who might be the bravest and mightiest Lord
upon earth.</p>

<p>Now, this is how Wulnoth served seven years with
Osth the giant, and this is how he lost Edgiva the
Beautiful and Wyborga the Wise.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

<small><em>Of Wulnoth's Strange Wrestling in the
Place of Desolation</em></small></h2>


<p>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_074.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">F</span>or a day and a night did
Wulnoth remain in that
place, giving way to his sorrow,
for a strange weakness
had taken possession of him,
and it seemed as though
there was naught left to live
for in this world. And in
the long night hours did
evil voices whisper in his
ear, as though the wicked warlocks counselled him,
and the storm sisters sped by on the wind, and they
also seemed to mock at him.</p>

<p>"Of what use is it to think of searching for thy
friend?" the voices said. "Of what use to remember
Edgiva the Beautiful, who is a king's daughter? Of
what use to remember the words of Wyborga, who has
mocked thee? Thou art nameless and landless and
thrall born, and hast only thy strength and no wisdom.
Go to the hills and join the nameless ones and the
masterless men, and be their leader, and spread fire and
carry sword, and make thyself a name that shall be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>feared, and put all these dreams from thee. There are
fair maidens to capture and strongholds to take, and
thus thou shalt be strong. But if thou dost wander
after the friend whom thou mayst never find, or seek
the great one who may never be met with, then thou
shalt be known as the Wanderer only, and no scald
shall sing a song to thee."</p>

<p>And Wulnoth, seated there in the darkness of the
forest, said to himself that this thing was best, and that
he would go and join the nameless ones and the masterless
men, and become a robber-lord to be feared.</p>

<p>But when the day dawned and the night shadows
fled, then the birds began to sing in the woodlands and
the earth smiled again, and better voices came to Wulnoth
and spoke in the land-breeze and sang in the
bird-song and whispered in the leaves-talk; and all
these voices said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why tarry here, O Wulnoth, when all the work
is before thee&mdash;when the hours pass and are not used?
Look up, and rise up, and go forth and begin."</p>

<p>"Yet I know not where to begin," said Wulnoth,
and the voices seemed to answer&mdash;</p>

<p>"One step at a time, and the longest journey is
completed. Rise up and search, for the seeker shall be
the finder, if in seeking he weary not."</p>

<p>"Now," thought Wulnoth, "this is surely right,
for I do but waste time sitting idle, and even if I seek
the masterless men, I shall not find them by staying
here."</p>

<p>So Wulnoth rose, and he plucked a stout branch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>from a tree for a weapon, in case any sought to harm
him; and he strode through the forest and came to the
road, and then he knew that it was the road he had
often walked by the side of Edgiva the Beautiful&mdash;the
road back to Lethra.</p>

<p>"I will go and see the King's hall," he said. "Perchance
some dwell there even now who may tell me of
Guthred."</p>

<p>But alas, when he reached the place where Lethra
had flourished, all was silence and ashes and desolation.
Here stood the blackened walls, and there lay beam and
iron, while down at the fiord, the weed-covered wrecks
of the long ships could still be seen.</p>

<p>No living thing was there, for the work of the sea-kings
had been thorough, and the vengeance of Hungwar
and Hubba had been complete, and Lethra was the
place of desolation now.</p>

<p>Then a deep anger filled the heart of Wulnoth as
he stood surveying the ruins, and he cried aloud&mdash;</p>

<p>"I will find these pirates and make them pay for
this, and I will find Guthred the Prince and set him
back on his throne, and I will find Edgiva the Beautiful,
though I have to wander the world o'er to do it."</p>

<p>And then a deep mocking laugh sounded, and he
turned to behold who thus jeered at his words, for tears
were gone and weakness had fled, and his heart burned
for the man's game.</p>

<p>And there, seated amidst the dust and black ashes
of the place of desolation, he saw a man&mdash;a great and
mighty man&mdash;who sat and eyed him; and Wulnoth's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>heart was full of wonder, for this man was so like himself
that it was as though he looked upon his own form
in the clear forest pool or the well's cool depths.</p>

<p>"Why dost thou laugh at me? and who art thou
who art so like myself that thou mightest be my
brother? and by what name art thou called?" he cried.
And the other laughed again.</p>

<p>"I am called Wulnoth, stranger," he answered.
"Wulnoth, Cerdic's son, thou talker of big words and
doer of little deeds." And at that Wulnoth answered in
hot rage&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now in that thou liest, whoever thou art, for I am
Wulnoth, Cerdic's son."</p>

<p>"Thou Cerdic's son! Thou art a nithing to weep
at sorrow's touch, to faint at difficulty, and to listen to
night voices. Thou Cerdic's son!"</p>

<p>"Now," thought Wulnoth, "who am I? Has Wyborga
cast some strange spell upon me, or did the night
wanderers bewitch me in yonder forest? And if I be
not Wulnoth, then who am I?"</p>

<p>"Well, wanderer," this strange man said at length,
"dost thou own that thou hast spoken falsely? Dost
thou still call thyself Cerdic's son?"</p>

<p>"That do I," replied Wulnoth. "Whoever thou
art, thou art not Wulnoth."</p>

<p>"Whoever thou art, thou liest," came the reply.
"I am Wulnoth, and I mean to gather a band of masterless
men, and in this place of desolation to build Lethra
again and here to reign as king."</p>

<p>"That thou shalt not," answered Wulnoth quickly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>And the other laughed and asked him why he should
not.</p>

<p>"Because I am Wulnoth," replied he, "and because
I go to seek Guthred the Prince, and to bring him here
to reign in his father's halls once more."</p>

<p>"That thou shalt not," answered the other. "It
seems to me, nameless one who callest thyself Wulnoth,
that there is not room for us twain in the world, and
that one of us must conquer the other. Therefore cast
aside thy club and come holmgang with me. Yea, here
in the place of desolation, with no arms but our strength,
will we fight until one shall overcome the other."</p>

<p>"I am well content," replied Wulnoth, and he
cast aside the club. "Let it be as thou sayest, thou
who callest thyself Wulnoth and who speakest a
lie."</p>

<p>"Deeds, not words, thou man with a woman's
tongue," growled the other; and then they faced each
other, and gripped, and swayed, and strained, while the
black ashes and the gray dust of the ruins of Lethra rose
in clouds about them.</p>

<p>Now Wulnoth was strong, and he thought within
himself that after his wrestling with Osth the giant,
and his conquering of the bear, this would be but an
easy matter, but to his surprise he found that the
stranger was strong as he, and knew every one of his
tricks, and could match him in every way, so that Wulnoth,
strive as he might, could gain no victory.</p>

<p>All the day they fought, until the evening shadows
crept from the cloudland, and then they paused, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>flung themselves panting on the ground, and the
stranger laughed and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well wrestled, Wanderer. Thou hast tried, but
thou canst not succeed, and when the day dawns we will
fight again, and I shall conquer thee, and then I will
either slay thee or make thee my thrall, and thou shalt
know that I am Wulnoth, Cerdic's son."</p>

<p>"Though you conquer and slay me," answered
Wulnoth, "that will I not know. You may be warlock
or mountain troll who has stolen my shape and who
uses magic against me, but Wulnoth, the son of Cerdic,
you are not."</p>

<p>"Tarry till the morning and I will prove it," said
the other. But Wulnoth answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"Nay, why should we tarry; by night as by day
can we fight. Come, prove it now."</p>

<p>"I am hungry and weary, and desire to quaff from
the wine horn," the other replied. "Let us do that first
and fight afterwards."</p>

<p>"Not so," answered Wulnoth. "We will make an
end of this matter, and that at once."</p>

<p>"Now, evil seize thee," growled the other. "For
this I will surely slay thee. Yet fight, if it is in thy
mind to do so."</p>

<p>So they gripped again, and wrestled, and strove,
yet still Wulnoth could gain no victory; and as the
night deepened, it seemed that the other grew the
stronger, so that he cast Wulnoth to the earth and
laughed and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I conquer! I conquer, Wanderer, and bitter shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>be the drink in which you pledge me. Now cry for
mercy."</p>

<p>"I cry for no mercy," answered Wulnoth, speaking
short and hoarse. "Come, let us make an end of
this."</p>

<p>So there on the ground they wrestled, the stranger
on top and Wulnoth beneath seeking to cast him off,
and so they struggled until the sun rose; and then
stronger and stronger Wulnoth seemed to grow, and
weaker and weaker the stranger became, until he fell,
and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I can fight no more. Thou hast beaten me.
Yet thou wouldst not have done this save for that
shadow."</p>

<p>He pointed, as he spoke, to the earth, and Wulnoth
looked and wondered; for two of the timbers of the
ruined king's hall still stood, and they caught the beams
of the rising sun, and upon the ground their shadows
fell just where the two had struggled, and the shadows
formed&mdash;a cross, the sign of the weak one whom Wulnoth
had called nithing!</p>

<p>Then cried Wulnoth and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"O stranger, who didst take my name and whom
I have conquered, can you tell me this riddle, for I am
weary of mysteries. Whence comes it that yonder
shadow made me strong and you weak?"</p>

<p>"'T is the sign of the mightiest and the strongest,"
answered the other, and at that Wulnoth laughed aloud
in mockery&mdash;</p>

<p>"'T is the sign of one who was a nithing," he said;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>"and yet, if it made me strong, why did it not make
thee strong also?"</p>

<p>"Thou wouldst not understand even if I told thee,
Wanderer," was the reply. And Wulnoth spoke again&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now confess that thou didst lie when thou didst
take my name." But the other replied&mdash;</p>

<p>"I lied not, for of a surety I am Wulnoth, Cerdic's
son!"</p>

<p>"Now this passes all!" cried Wulnoth. "Then
who may I be, if thou art Wulnoth?"</p>

<p>"The Wanderer, and thou shalt wander until thy
task is done. Yet remember that again thou hast rejected
the Strong, and called Him the weak. Hither was
I sent to meet thee and to conquer thee, and thou hast
conquered me. Well for thee that thou hast conquered
Wulnoth, Cerdic's son, for unless thou hadst done this,
thou wouldst never have conquered others; and it was
for this purpose that Wyborga the Wise sent thee to
tarry with Osth the giant to learn strength."</p>

<p>"Thou wilt bewilder me with words," cried Wulnoth
impatiently. "I tell thee that I am Wulnoth.
Moreover, it was Wulnoth whom Osth did teach, and
since thou ownest that he taught me, thou ownest that
I am Wulnoth, and thou provest thyself false."</p>

<p>"I may not explain this to thee," was the answer.
"Some day thou shalt understand it."</p>

<p>"Some day!" was Wulnoth's angry reply. "Why
are all the good things promised thus? The future
must be stored with them, and the now has never a
one."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>
<p>"The future has all golden store, Wulnoth, since
so thou wilt have it. And now farewell."</p>

<p>"Not so fast," cried Wulnoth. "I have conquered
thee, and thou art my man now."</p>

<p>"And truly so, and truly I shall serve thee even
though thou mayst not know it. Yet beware of one
thing&mdash;thou must watch me, for I may yet turn and
smite thee. I tell thee, Wulnoth, that I am thy best
friend and thy worst foe&mdash;weak am I and yet I am
thy strength. Seek not to keep me now."</p>

<p>"Oh, go thy way! Thou art like all the rest, filled
with riddles and dark sayings. Yet before thou dost
go tell me one thing, and plainly, if it be in thee to
speak to the point."</p>

<p>"Ask thy question," said the other. And Wulnoth
went on&mdash;</p>

<p>"Whither must I turn to seek for Guthred son of
Hardacnute, who was King of Lethra in his day&mdash;canst
thou tell me that?"</p>

<p>"By Hungwar and by Hubba was he carried off,"
answered the other. "From them must you seek him.
Seek the Danes, Wanderer, yet in seeking hold thy
counsel, for Hungwar hath a long memory, and his
face still beareth a scar of a wound made by a broken
sword once in this very spot. And, moreover, the
names of Cerdic, thrall of Berwulf, and of Wulnoth,
the son of Cerdic, might be remembered. So keep
thy counsel, and call thyself the Wanderer if thou
come to the Danish sea-kings." And with that this
strange man turned and hastened away, leaving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>Wulnoth seated there wondering, yet sore spent with
his fight.</p>

<p>"Now, this is passing strange," Wulnoth reflected.
"Yet the advice is good, for where shall I glean tidings
of the Prince save from the Danes who carried him
off?"</p>

<p>Then he paused a moment and cried out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, by my word! Who so mighty and strong
as Regner Lodbrok? There is Wyborga's rede! I
will seek Regner Lodbrok the Dane, and to him will
I give service."</p>

<p>Then he rose, and lo, his eye fell upon the shadow
again, and he frowned and shook his head.</p>

<p>"There is some dark rede in all this," he mused,
"and I must try and come by its meaning. 'T is but a
shadow, yet as it fell upon me I grew strong and conquered
yonder strange being."</p>

<p>He stood pressing his feet idly into the dust and
pondering, and presently his foot struck something
buried in the ashes, and he stooped and put down his
hand. And then he uttered a cry of joy, for he drew
out a mighty sword with good handle, fashioned so that
the fingers could grip it well, and with long, well-tempered
blade, pointed and double-edged, which the
dry ashes, piled high over it, had preserved bright and
free from rust.</p>

<p>"By Thor, a right good weapon!" he laughed, as
he swung it round, making it sing its song in the air.
"A right good weapon, and how it makes the heart
rejoice to feel the fingers clasp such a friend! Now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>I have a long road to tread, and none can say what may
befall in the journey or at its close, yet the way is
clear thus far&mdash;I must seek Regner Lodbrok the
Danish sea-king, and from him shall I glean tidings of
Guthred the Prince." And with that Wulnoth, who
called himself the Wanderer, turned from the place
of desolation, carrying the great sword in his hand.</p>

<p>Now, this is how Wulnoth wrestled with one who
called himself by his name, and this is how he started
to seek for Regner Lodbrok, the mightiest of all the
sea-kings of Denmark.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

<small><em>Of the Coming of Wulnoth to the
Danish Sea-kings</em></small></h2>


<p>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_085.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">F</span>or many days did Wulnoth
journey southward, for
though Lethra was nigh the
sea, and the journey over the
Westarweg was the shortest
road, yet he had no boat
in which to sail, and, moreover,
the time of the storms
was coming, and he knew
that to sail alone was to seek
for death.</p>

<p>So by land he was forced to go, and the way was
long and hard, and many were the times that he felt he
would abide where he was, and give up this vain search.</p>

<p>And strange was it that whenever these thoughts
came to him, then also came the strange being who was
so like himself, and he would cry to Wulnoth to wrestle
with him ere he went farther, and only when Wulnoth
had wrestled and conquered was he able to go on again.</p>

<p>Many were the adventures which he met with,
and many the perils he encountered, yet, still, in spite
of all, he went his way over the long, long leagues
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>towards the southern sea, where he must perforce take
ship of some kind if he wished to reach the sea-king's
land on the other side of the wild Baltic, whereon the
storm-king makes his dwelling-place and rides in his
flying palace of lightning and tempest.</p>

<p>He made himself a light spear of hard wood, and
with this he hunted the wild goats and the forest swine,
and took their flesh for his food, and on this and on the
wild berries did he live, and for his drink he had the
runnels of clear water and nothing else.</p>

<p>By day he journeyed and by night he slept in the
hollow trees or in caves, living like a wild man and a
berserker, and, moreover, looking like one also, since
his face was all grown with a wild beard and his hair
hung in tangled masses to his shoulders.</p>

<p>In those dark nights, when the storms raged and
the forest groaned beneath the buffets of the blast, evil
voices called and made mock, urging him to give up so
wild a journey, but in the day time the better voices
always answered and encouraged him; and oft in his
dreams Edgiva the Beautiful would stand beside him
and smile, and beckon him on, whispering to him in
tones like the sweet music of the scald's harp&mdash;</p>

<p>"Be brave, Wulnoth! Be patient, Wulnoth, for
fame, and honor, and love, and that which is better than
fame or honor or love await thee in the end."</p>

<p>And when Edgiva stood thus, it ever seemed that
she ever held that little cross of wood, bound with
grass and wreathed with thorn spray, which Wyborga
the Wise had fashioned in the days long past.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>
<p>So through the forests and across the mountains
and over dreary wastes did Wulnoth go, and of those
whom he met his only question was whether he was
journeying towards the sea-king's land.</p>

<p>"Thou art going aright," he was answered each
time he asked that question. "Thou wilt come to the
sea, and there thou must take ship. But beware what
thou doest in the sea-king's land, for fierce and cruel are
the vikings, and their swords sing loudly."</p>

<p>Once, deep in a wild forest, he met a band of masterless
men, who sprang up and seized their weapons and
bade him stand, and then demanded his name and
business.</p>

<p>"I am nameless, and called the Wanderer," he said
fearlessly. "As for my business, that is my own alone,
yet this I say, I seek the sea-kings of Denmark."</p>

<p>"Then thou seekest a right jolly company," laughed
the robber chief. "Bold and daring are they, and there
are no warriors to beat them. Yet I prefer to keep my
feet on the dry land and to dwell with my jolly company
here in the depths of the forest. Now, Wanderer,
thou art a goodly man, and that great sword of thine
looks a goodly sword. How sayest thou? Abide with
us and be content, and thou shalt have fun and plunder
enough and to spare, and hardly a day shall pass but
thy sword shall sing its merry song while the red flames
burst from the roof. The life of the masterless man
may not be so full of adventure, but 't is also less full of
peril. Not that I fear peril from the weapons of a stout
foeman, but, by Odin, I care little for the thought of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>being sucked down into the depths of the sea for kraken
and other monsters to make a meal of me. Stay with
us, thou Wanderer, and be of our company."</p>

<p>But to that Wulnoth made reply that this might
not be since he had a task to do, and might not turn
from it; and the robber asked him what his task might
be.</p>

<p>"I want to seek out the mightiest king and the
strongest lord," explained Wulnoth. And the robber
laughed.</p>

<p>"Methinks thou hast a hard task before thee, Wanderer,"
he said. "For yonder in the Danish land, and
beyond that in the land of the Saxons, which methinks
thou must have come from, and beyond that again in
the land of the Franks, thou wilt find many who cry
that they are the mightiest and bravest; and yet, by
the hammer of the great Thor, they are mighty only
because they have the swords and axes and spears of
fools who are content to shed their blood that their
lords may snatch the gain. Not so do we, where all
share alike."</p>

<p>"Methinks, though, that old Lodbrok is truly a
mighty man, if the stories that I have heard of him are
true," said Wulnoth. And the robber nodded.</p>

<p>"Ay, a mighty man. I know few more so."</p>

<p>"But death is mightier than Lodbrok the dragon-slayer,"
cried another man. And the captain answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"True. To the old viking, Death, all heads must
bow at last, for Death is strongest and last of all."</p>

<p>"Death is strongest of all!" mused Wulnoth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>"Then did Wyborga mean that if I would find Guthred
and win Edgiva I must be ready to die? If that is
so, then I need not travel far, for death may be met
with everywhere."</p>

<p>"I warn thee of one thing, Wanderer," said one of
the robbers. "If thou goest to Lodbrok, the son of
Sigurd, beware of his two sons, for they are merciless
as the edge of the sword, and fiercer than the flames in
war time. By my beard, I had rather keep beyond their
reach&mdash;the hug of the bear is gentle compared with the
hand grasp of Hungwar or Hubba his brother."</p>

<p>"Though Hungwar and Hubba be terrible as the
storm god and fiercer than the fire, yet I go on," said
Wulnoth stoutly. "My way must be straight as the
birds' road, nor may anything turn me aside."</p>

<p>"Then go on and prosper, thou Wanderer of the
stout heart," the masterless men answered, "but we
abide in the woods and live our merry life."</p>

<p>So Wulnoth, after that he had eaten and rested and
warmed himself at the fire around which the robbers
sat, their faces glowing red in the flame light, passed on
his way, his sword in hand, ready for any dangers that
might meet him on the road.</p>

<p>And so he journeyed day by day until he came to
a town, and there the people stared at him and asked&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who is this stranger with the big sword, who
looks wild as a berserker?"</p>

<p>And the lord of the place sent for him, and demanded
his business; and when he knew that Wulnoth
sought the sea-kings out, he said sternly&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>
<p>"There be not ropes enough nor trees enough
whereon to hang the pirates of Juteland and Denmark,
who are the scourge of all honest peoples, and goest
thou to join them, stranger? Now methinks that I
ought to hang thee rather than let thee go on."</p>

<p>"There may be two sides to that, jarl," answered
Wulnoth calmly. "Not while I hold my sword will
any one lightly talk of hanging me. Yet this I say,
jarl&mdash;there may be other reasons why one seeks the
sea-kings out. The flames may have burst from the roof
and the sword may have sung its song, and there may
be a debt to pay, lord jarl; therefore let me go my way."</p>

<p>"And go thou shalt if that is in thy mind," answered
the jarl, "though in truth thou must be a bold
man if thou art going alone to such a task."</p>

<p>"One may ofttimes accomplish that wherein a
score would fail, jarl," was the reply; "therefore again
I say let me go in peace, and perchance thou mayst
hear a tale one of these days, and in that tale I, the
Wanderer, may perchance play a part."</p>

<p>Then the jarl sent him on his way, and at length
Wulnoth reached the coast, after many long and weary
days of trial; and there before him, dark and vast, the
stormy Baltic heaved, and across that dark water the
grim rock-bound shores of Denmark lay.</p>

<p>Now on the rocky shore a village was built, and
thither went Wulnoth to ask if he could get ship to
Denmark, but not one of those who dwelt there would
listen to his words.</p>

<p>"Quite close enough are we to our neighbors," they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>said. "We have no desire to come nearer if it may
be helped, whilst as for the sea, the storms will be
sweeping it in a few days now, and we have no wish
to become food for the kraken."</p>

<p>"Now," thought Wulnoth to himself, "I am as
far off as ever, for this sea I must cross, and yet I
cannot get ship to bear me."</p>

<p>And down to the foot of the dark cliffs he went,
gazing across the water, and pondering upon how he
might cross it; and while he stood there, yet once again
there came he who had called himself Wulnoth, and he
stood and mocked at him and cried&mdash;</p>

<p>"So, Wanderer, thou hast got thus far, and now
thou art stopped. Now thou shalt wrestle with me yet
once again, and I will carry thee back to the land from
which thou hast journeyed and there help thee to make
a name for thyself."</p>

<p>Then did Wulnoth utter a cry of anger, and he
seized this man whom he before had overthrown, and
he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now am I weary of thy gibing and thy worry,
thou who callest thyself by my name, and whom I have
already overthrown more than once. Now we will indeed
make an end, and if there is no other way, then
will I swim this water, but thou shalt swim it with me."</p>

<p>And once again they struggled there on the weed-strewn
shore, and this time Wulnoth had easy mastery&mdash;for
each time they had fought he had grown the
stronger and the other had become weaker, and now he
soon vanquished him, and he cried&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>
<p>"Now thou and I will swim together, and if we
perish then it is done with."</p>

<p>But to this the other answered, crying in terror&mdash;</p>

<p>"Not yet, Wanderer! Not yet! I will show thee
a better way."</p>

<p>"And what is that way?" asked Wulnoth. "Speak
quickly, for I have no mind to tarry."</p>

<p>Then the other pointed out a spot to Wulnoth, and
there two great bears came slyly down to make war
against a great monster of the deep&mdash;one shaped like
a seal but ever so much larger&mdash;larger than the largest
ox, with huge tusks like unto the horns of a wild bull
set in its upper jaw and protruding downwards, and
with moustache like a viking lord's on its lip.</p>

<p>"The bears will attack the sea-cow," said the
strange man. "Now watch, and when the battle is
fierce, take thy sword and slay the bears, and then ask
the sea-cow to aid thee."</p>

<p>So Wulnoth watched, full of wonder, and the two
bears came down and flung themselves upon the sea-cow
who had been sleeping there on the shore, and the
mighty animal made a valiant fight and smote hard with
its tusks, and the whole air trembled with the bellowings
and roarings of the strife. But the bears got one
on either side, and Wulnoth saw that the fight was
going against the sea-cow and that it would be slain.
So he drew his sword and he rushed at the bears, and
smote strong strokes, so that one was slain and the
other fled, leaving the track of its blood to tell of Wulnoth's
strong hand.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>
<p>Then the sea-cow turned and spoke in deep hoarse
tones, and Wulnoth wondered that he could understand
its speech, not knowing that Wyborga the Wise had
put this into his mind. And the sea-cow said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Greeting to thee, O Wanderer, and thanks for the
help of thy hand and thy sword, for without that help
methinks the bears would have made an end of me.
Now, therefore, tell me what is in thine heart, and if it
may be I will do it."</p>

<p>So Wulnoth made known his desire to cross the
water, and the sea-cow laughed at that.</p>

<p>"It is a light task for me that you have set, Wanderer,"
it said. "Nor will it take long to fulfil. Now
get thee on to my back and hold thee still, and I will
do thy behest and carry thee to Denmark."</p>

<p>Then Wulnoth, greatly marvelling, obeyed, and
clambered upon the monster's broad back. And the sea-cow
beat the waves with her mighty flippers and
cleaved her way through the sea, faster than the fastest
ship could sail, until the shores of the North faded and
the shores of the South grew clear, and then, beating
against the wind and making for the land, they saw
a long ship with shields along the sides and the raven
banner overhead, and Wulnoth knew that it was a vessel
of the sea-kings, and he hailed it across the waves.</p>

<p>Now in the ship the rowers sat tugging at the oars
and the leaders gathered on the prow and looked across
the water, laughing and jesting. A big, fierce, warlike
set they were, grizzled in battle and marked with
many marks of the war game; and as they talked and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>laughed, suddenly over the waves rang the sound of a
voice, and they stared in fear to see a great man, shaggy
as a berserker, with long yellow hair and blue eyes,
come speeding towards them upon the back of a sea
monster.</p>

<p>"By Thor!" cried one. "'T is surely some warlock
come to do us harm. Let us flee."</p>

<p>But another, who was leader of the pirates, answered
with a fierce oath and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Warlock or not, I flee not from anything. If the
hour of the death-song comes, it comes, therefore round
with the ship and let us go to meet this being, who
thus calls to us from out the swan bath."</p>

<p>So round came the ship, and near Wulnoth approached,
and he cried aloud&mdash;</p>

<p>"Greeting to you, viking lords; I come to meet
you."</p>

<p>"Greeting to thee, stranger," they answered. "And
who art thou who sailest the swan bath in so strange
a ship, and what dost thou want with us?"</p>

<p>"I am the Wanderer," answered Wulnoth. "So
am I called, for I have wandered far, seeking that which
I seek, and I have come to you because ye perchance
may know of that which I want."</p>

<p>"By Thor, this is passing strange," muttered the
viking lord, whilst the rowers sat open-mouthed and
wide-eyed. "'T is strange, and none who have not
seen this will believe it." Then he said aloud&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tell me, Wanderer, what is it that thou dost seek
so straitly?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>
<p>"The strongest and mightiest of lords," answered
Wulnoth, "and so I have heard Regner Lodbrok called,
and hither have I come seeking for him."</p>

<p>"And by the beard of Beorn, thou hast sought a
right worthy lord," the viking replied. "For there is
none more mighty than old Regner, Sigurd's son. But
he is not in his hall now. Four moons ago he sailed
to East Anglia and we await his message to join him.
But his sons are in the hall, and Hungwar and Hubba
are names known to men. Also there is the renowned
Guthrun there, awaiting tidings from Regner. To
these chiefs of fame thou canst make thy story known
if thou desirest. But how comes it that thou ridest
the waves in so strange a fashion?"</p>

<p>"Because I could get no man to let me have ship,
all fearing to come too nigh your coasts."</p>

<p>"Ay," laughed the vikings, "they know our greetings
are somewhat rough. But what of thy steed, Wanderer?
Thou hast not told that!"</p>

<p>"The steed I found and rendered some service to,
and for my payment he brought me over, as you see.
Now shall I come into your ship, or shall I race you
across?"</p>

<p>"A race, a race!" cried the vikings, and they bent
to their oars, and they stretched the sail, and flew before
the wind. But swift though they went, swifter still
sped the sea-cow, and when they reached the land, there
stood Wulnoth to greet them, and the sea-cow had gone
back to the depths.</p>

<p>"Thou hast won the race, Wanderer," they said,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>"and never did man win in stranger fashion. Yet never
mind that now. Come thou with us, and we will lead
thee to our lords. And look that thou answer firmly
and without fear, and in few words, for Hungwar loveth
not long speech nor to be crossed, and the rod and
the sword are his only words to any whom he thinks
nithing."</p>

<p>"I am well content," answered Wulnoth. "Lead
the way." And so to the sea-king's hall he was
conducted.</p>

<p>Now, this is how Wulnoth crossed the swans' bath,
and how he met the vikings, and was led to the presence
of the Danish sea-kings.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small><em>Of what befell Wulnoth in the Halls of
the Danes</em></small></h2>


<p>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_097.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">I</span>n the great hall of Regner
Lodbrok sat his two sons
who ruled in his absence,
together with many a great
holda of Juteland and Denmark
and other vikings from
the North who had gathered
with them. The room was
long and low, and its oaken
beams were black with age
and smoke. Its walls were covered with skins and
horns and trophies of the chase, and laden with shields
and swords and other warlike gear.</p>

<p>Great torches, fixed in iron sconces, cast a smoky
glare on the scene, and on the mighty hearth a huge
fire of logs burnt, and the blue smoke curled upwards to
escape through a hole in the roof.</p>

<p>The upper end of the room was slightly raised,
and there, in carved chairs at a table which ran crosswise
the width of the hall, the nobles sat quaffing the
brown ale from their deep drinking horns.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>
<p>There, side by side, Hungwar and Hubba sat, older
and fiercer now than when Wulnoth had seen them
lead the attack at Lethra, and they had been bad enough
then.</p>

<p>Hungwar, the elder of the brothers, was shaggy
as the bear, but Hubba was smooth of face save for his
heavy moustache, and on Hungwar's cheek was a scar
as of a sword cut.</p>

<p>And there also sat Bacseg, King of the North
Danes, and Halfdane the Fierce, and Sidroc the Cruel,
and Osbern, and Frena, and Harold, all viking lords,
holdas of high birth and warriors of fame, and each
was clad in his war gear, and each had his weapons
ready to hand; for words were few and blows quick in
those days, and even the feasting might become the
warring before men could understand the cause of the
quarrel.</p>

<p>Set crosswise to the table, and running down the
length of the room like the longer line of the letter T,
was another table, and here the soldiers and the lesser
leaders sat at their feasting, and the place rang with
shouts of laughter and wild jest, and ever and anon with
the music of the harp and the song of the scald, singing
the praises of one or other of the captains; and into
this company was Wulnoth led by the captain of those
whom he had met.</p>

<p>"How now, Wahrmund!" cried Hungwar as he
caught sight of the captain. "So thou hast come back,
thou old wolf; and what of thy voyaging, eh?"</p>

<p>"The voyage was quick and the task short,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>Hungwar," came the answer. "And the men of Osric
are scattered and their homes given to the flame!"</p>

<p>"Good!" cried the leaders as they heard. "Osric
will not defy our might again." And then Hungwar
went on, staring at Wulnoth&mdash;</p>

<p>"But what flaxen-haired giant of the South have
you here, Wahrmund? Is this a captive from the foe?
That cannot be, seeing that he is unbound and has his
sword by his side. Who is this giant, and what does he
here?"</p>

<p>"By Thor, he is a goodly man to look upon," cried
one noble, bending forward and staring at Wulnoth.
"I love a man when I see one, and yonder one is."</p>

<p>Then he raised his horn and cried to Wulnoth&mdash;</p>

<p>"Waes heal, stranger of the blue eyes and yellow
hair," and to him Wulnoth answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"Drinc heal, lord."</p>

<p>"Now, by Odin and his twelve companions,"
growled Hubba, "one would think that we have no
men in Denmark, noble Guthrun, that thou must make
so much of this berserker."</p>

<p>This Guthrun was a brawny, broad-shouldered
giant himself, and his hair was plaited in two long plaits
which fell on either side his face, and on his arms he
had massy bracelets of gold. He seemed a good-humored
man, for he roared with laughter at Hubba's
words and made answer&mdash;</p>

<p>"Not so, Hubba. We be men enough, and therefore
we should love all men, be they friend or foe&mdash;and,
by my word, I love a good foeman. As for being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>berserker, this stranger is none the worse for that in
my eyes so that he be a dealer of lusty blows."</p>

<p>"How came ye by this man, Wahrmund?" asked
Hungwar, stopping what might have led to a quarrel.
And all listened while the viking told his tale.</p>

<p>And when he was done Hungwar turned to Wulnoth,
who had stood there erect and calm, and all eyes
were bent upon him.</p>

<p>"This is a strange tale that we hear, stranger," he
said. "So thou comest to us through the swans' bath,
riding a sea-monster like a horse. By my faith, most
of thy people&mdash;for surely thou art Saxon by thy eyes
and hair&mdash;most of thy people, I say, rather shun us.
Now tell us thy tale&mdash;for surely thou hast fled from
some fate that thou didst deserve. Thou art nameless
and landless, I'll warrant me."</p>

<p>"Or else I should not come to those who take land
with their sword," answered Wulnoth, and at this the
vikings laughed, and said that surely this was a merry
fellow. But Hungwar frowned, and said sternly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thou hast a sharp tongue, stranger, but we love
sharp swords. Thou hast a quick word, but we love
quick deeds."</p>

<p>"Blow and deed will be quick enough when the
time comes," Wulnoth made answer, and he looked into
Hungwar's face and noted the scar that his sword had
made in the past. "For myself, I am the Wanderer,
for I have wandered far in my search. For my place,
I come from the North, whither I was taken in my
childhood after that the sword of the Dane had harried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>our land. As thou sayest, I am landless and nameless,
and, moreover, a thrall&mdash;though I have rent the thrall
collar from my neck, having somewhat outgrown its
size, and he who placed it there being dead. Yet that
makes little difference to thee, seeing that it is said that
thou lovest those who strike strong blows better than
those who have noble blood."</p>

<p>"Be it as it may. Thou hast come to serve under
me, then?" cried the Dane.</p>

<p>But to this Wulnoth said, "Nay. I am seeking
the bravest, the mightiest, and the noblest in the
world." And at that Hungwar frowned and smote the
table.</p>

<p>"Thou dog!" he cried. "Am I not he?" And at
that Wulnoth laughed.</p>

<p>"Why, Hungwar, did I say ay to that, I might
have all the holdas here flying at me or falling upon
thee. Nay, I seek one whose name is greater than even
thine&mdash;I seek Regner Lodbrok, thy father." And at
that all there cried that it was well, and that Regner
Lodbrok was the champion of champions.</p>

<p>"So thou seekest to serve my father," sneered
Hungwar. "Now, by my beard, he who seeks such
honor must of the honor be worthy. If thou wouldst
serve none but the bravest and mightiest, thou thyself
must be brave and mighty."</p>

<p>"Wouldst that I match myself against thee, Hungwar?"
asked Wulnoth calmly. And at that the holdas
laughed, for they liked to see Hungwar baited; but
Hungwar frowned darkly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>
<p>"Thou art over bold, Wanderer," he said. "The
bloodhound runs not with the wolf."</p>

<p>"But the wolf sometimes pulls down the bloodhound,
Hungwar," was the ready answer. "But enough
of such talk. Thou desirest to see my strength. So be
it. How shall we test it?"</p>

<p>Then Hungwar took up a block of wood and gave
it to Wulnoth, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let us see what thy sword is worth, Wanderer.
Split me that block at one blow." And at that Wulnoth
laughed mockingly.</p>

<p>"Too easy a task, Hungwar," he answered. "Far
too easy. Let me see thee rend it asunder with thy
naked hands."</p>

<p>"Thou art drunk, fool!" roared the Dane. "No
man living may do that."</p>

<p>"We will see," answered Wulnoth, and placing the
block carefully, he bent one knee upon it and gripped
it with both hands, while all there rose to their feet to
watch him. Then slowly and steadily he pulled, and the
muscles of his arms and back stood out like ropes, and
he thought within himself that his work with Osth was
bearing fruit now. And as he pulled there was a sharp
sound of rending wood, and the block fell apart in
twain, while all there shouted till the roof rang at this
great deed.</p>

<p>"Now, by my beard!" cried King Bacseg, "but
we have a mighty man here. What sayest thou,
Hubba?"</p>

<p>"Strong arms and strong wits go not always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>together. The bear is strong, but the fox beats him
in cunning."</p>

<p>"Now, that may be," shouted Guthrun, "but we
love strong arms rather than quick brains. Still, methinks
the Wanderer is not slow of wit either&mdash;and
he brags not as some do," he added to himself.</p>

<p>"What other task wilt thou set me, Hungwar, son
of Regner?" asked Wulnoth. "Since I seek thy father's
service, I am willing to prove that I am worthy of it."
And Hungwar frowned, for, he knew not why, he felt
hate for this stranger, and would gladly have put him to
shame.</p>

<p>"Perchance the block was cracked," he said, "and
I noticed it not." And Wulnoth smiled and answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"Perchance it was."</p>

<p>Then he picked up an iron mace, with the handle
an inch thick, and he held it up.</p>

<p>"Some of you strike hard blows," he said. "Which,
then, will sever this with a clean cut with one blow of
the sword?"</p>

<p>"I will try," cried Guthrun, for he, like all the
vikings, loved trial of strength.</p>

<p>So he took the mace and set it on the riven block,
and with bared arms he lifted his sword high in the air
and smote with all his force, and the sword bit deep
into the iron, but severed it not.</p>

<p>Then tried Osbern, and after him tried Halfdane,
and after him the Norse Jarl Eric, and after him Biorn
Ironsides the Mighty, and not one of them could cut
quite through the bar.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>
<p>Then Wulnoth took his great sword, and he said,
"Give me another bar, for this one is much cut now,
and let it be stouter and stronger."</p>

<p>"This braggart shall not humble us," thought
Hungwar, and he sent for his own mace, and the handle
was nigh two inches thick.</p>

<p>"Canst cut that, boaster?" he said; and Guthrun
cried out that it was not fair since 't was twice as thick
as the other.</p>

<p>But Wulnoth swung high his sword, and the keen
blade sang in the air like the scream of the gull as it
flies before the storm. And lo, the iron was sheered in
twain, clean cut, and the block beneath it split in two
beneath the blow.</p>

<p>"Skoal to the Wanderer!" cried the vikings.
"Worthy is he to be of our number!" But Wulnoth
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wilt set me another task, O Hungwar?"</p>

<p>"By Thor, I will set thee a task!" cried Hubba
fiercely. "All this is but child's play and has no danger
in it. Come hither, Wiglaf."</p>

<p>Then uprose a mighty man, with bare arms and
hairy, and he laughed grimly.</p>

<p>"What is thy pleasure, Hubba?" he asked. And
Hubba said to Wulnoth&mdash;</p>

<p>"See here, Wanderer. This man is our mightiest
boxer, and no man can stand a blow from his fist. Wilt
thou exchange a blow with him?"</p>

<p>"That will I," answered Wulnoth. "Strike thou,
Wiglaf."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>
<p>"Not so," shouted Guthrun. "That were a poor
test, for if Wiglaf strikes first, how shall Wanderer have
strength to strike back? Let them fight one round if
they will. By my father's name, 't will be a splendid
sight to see."</p>

<p>"So be it," laughed Wulnoth. "I care not," and
he and Wiglaf the Boxer faced each other.</p>

<p>"'T is a cruel man, Wanderer," whispered Wahrmund
in Wulnoth's ear, "and he fights not over fair.
Mind thyself, for he will kill thee if he can."</p>

<p>"If he can," answered Wulnoth; and then the
fighters faced each other, and the vikings forgot their
drinking horns and watched breathless.</p>

<p>For a little the pair feinted, and then Wiglaf rushed
forward and smote a mighty blow like to have felled an
ox. But Wulnoth caught it and turned it aside, and
then he smote and Wiglaf could not avoid the blow,
and though he caught it on his arm, there was a sound
like as of a breaking stick, and the boxer's arm fell helpless,
for the bone was broken.</p>

<p>Now all the vikings started to their feet and roared
that Wulnoth was worthy to be of the best of them;
and Hubba and Hungwar frowned, for they liked not
men who could do more than they dared.</p>

<p>Then did Wulnoth rise, and he spoke and
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"All the tasks that you have set me I have accomplished,
O holdas. Now I will take a task upon my
own shoulders, and if any of you dare try it, then do it
first. See you yon beast?" and he pointed to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>open beyond the door, where, in a fenced field, a great
shaggy bull bellowed and stamped.</p>

<p>"Well, what of him, Wanderer?" cried Guthrun
eagerly. "What new wonder canst thou show us?
Only be careful of that brute, for he has killed five men
already."</p>

<p>"Which of you will go and bring yon bull to his
knees with hand, and hand alone?" Wulnoth asked.
And Hungwar cried thickly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thou fool, there is no man on earth can do
it."</p>

<p>"That will we see," laughed Wulnoth lightly, and
setting his sword aside, he leaped the rails and entered
the bull's field, while all there crowded out to watch
him, thinking that the stranger would of a surety be
slain now.</p>

<p>And the bull glared at Wulnoth with bloodshot
eyes, and lowered its massive head, pawing the ground
and roaring deeply. Then, like a bolt, it charged, and
the onlookers gasped, for they thought that now the
daring man must perish. But quick as the bull moved,
quicker still was Wulnoth, and he sprang aside and let
the monster pass.</p>

<p>Then round wheeled the animal, but Wulnoth was
ready at its side, and he gripped the wide-spreading
horns and stood, and the bull stood pushing against him,
both motionless, man and animal.</p>

<p>"Now, by Odin!" shouted Hungwar, "the man is
in a poor case, for he cannot let go."</p>

<p>"And, by Odin!" shouted Guthrun, "he does not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>desire to let go. Look, look! who ever saw the like
of this?"</p>

<p>For now Wulnoth put out his strength and did as
he had been taught of old by Osth. First he pushed
the bull backwards, and then he gripped tighter and
swung mightily, and the bull was jerked off its feet;
and then he twisted sharply, putting out every bit of his
might, and the great beast cried in its pain and fell upon
its knees, and all the fierceness was gone out of it.</p>

<p>Then did the vikings leap up and run to Wulnoth
and lift him, and carry him round on their shoulders,
crying "Skoal" to him. But Hubba frowned darkly,
and bent towards his brother and whispered&mdash;</p>

<p>"I like not this fellow who has come to put us
to shame with his strength. We must look to this,
brother."</p>

<p>And to that Hungwar nodded, and answered back,
"Even so. But the dagger may turn greater strength
than this man's into weakness."</p>

<p>So the brothers spoke, and only Guthrun noticed
and heard the words they said.</p>

<p>Now, this is how Wulnoth showed his strength
before the Danish holdas, and this is how Guthrun
knew that the sons of Regner planned evil towards
the Wanderer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

<small><em>How the Sea-kings sailed for East
Anglia</em></small></h2>


<p>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_108.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">S</span>o Wulnoth tarried in the
Danish camp, and the vikings
greeted him as one of
themselves, but old Wahrmund
took him aside and
whispered more than once
that he should beware of
Wiglaf the Boxer as soon as
his arm was well.</p>

<p>"Wiglaf forgives no injury,"
he said, "and the greatest injury which thou
canst do to him is to beat him fairly. Therefore beware
of Wiglaf, O Wanderer."</p>

<p>"Surely a brave man should feel no bitterness
against him who overthrows him in fair fight!" answered
Wulnoth. But to that Wahrmund only said
again&mdash;</p>

<p>"Beware of Wiglaf when he is recovered."</p>

<p>And that was not the only warning that was received
by Wulnoth, for Guthrun the viking lord met
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>him, having sought such a meeting, and he said to him
grimly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wanderer, I love a man who plays the man's
game well and truly, but some there be who love
thee not; and if thou takest my advice, thou wilt not
tarry with the sons of Regner too long. Yet if thou
hast desire for service, my ships have places for such
warriors as thou art." And with that he went his way.</p>

<p>"Now," thought Wulnoth to himself, "truly this
is a hard case for me. If I tarry here, I am like to come
to harm; and if I tarry not, how shall I either meet with
this champion Regner Lodbrok, or learn tidings of
Prince Guthred my friend? Truly the Lord Guthrun
seems more noble than these sons of Regner, and yet
with them I must abide, methinks."</p>

<p>So for a week Wulnoth stayed there, and none
sought to do him harm, and even Hungwar spoke fairly
to him, having somewhat conquered his anger at Wiglaf's
defeat.</p>

<p>But it was with Wahrmund that Wulnoth spoke
most, for a friendship had grown between them, and
very cautiously did Wulnoth question the viking, not
letting him know the cause, and ask him if he remembered
aught of the conquest of Lethra.</p>

<p>"That do I," answered the warrior, laughing
deeply, "seeing that I fought there from first to last.
And that same King of Lethra was a hero, and fought
a good fight. Methinks sometimes that 't is a pity
there is so much sword-singing between brave men.
'T is our trade, yet sometimes I think that peace time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>is the best. Yea, I remember Lethra, and I mind
me of the anger of Hungwar because a boy&mdash;who
by the way was a Saxon thrall to Jarl Berwulf&mdash;smote
the champion with a broken sword, and left
its kiss upon his cheek, as thou seest until this day.
'T was my hand that cut the boy down, but by Thor,
he was a proper lad, and I have been sorry for it
since."</p>

<p>"But there was another boy there, comrade!" said
Wulnoth eagerly. "A son of Hardacnute. What was
his fate?"</p>

<p>The viking looked at him sharply and pondered a
moment.</p>

<p>"Wanderer, thou knowest far too much about
Lethra for thy health, if thy questioning come to the
ears of the holdas," he said sternly. "Thus I counsel
to question none save me, and if thy questions may be
answered with honor, then I will answer them. Dost
know thou mindest me of that Saxon boy, full grown
now? It might be ill for thee didst thou remind some
we know of in this same way."</p>

<p>"Wahrmund," said Wulnoth quietly, "thou art a
brave man and true, and now I will place my life in thy
hand, for of a truth I am that boy&mdash;Wulnoth the son
of Cerdic. Yet know, Wahrmund, that Cerdic was no
thrall to Berwulf, for Berwulf murdered the Saxon jarl
Tholk, and Cerdic refused to serve the Dane. And
when Berwulf had him whipped, then he smote him
with his own axe and fled, and, by Thor, 't was the deed
of a man to do that!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>
<p>"Perchance so," answered the other, and then
Wulnoth went on with his story&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, Wahrmund, in those days did the son of
Hardacnute make friendship with the outlaw Saxon
boy, and they swore to live as brothers; and on the day
when the evil came to Lethra&mdash;this was prophesied
by a wise woman&mdash;Guthred the Prince made me swear
that I would seek for him and aid him if might be; and
for this reason am I come to the camp, that of him I
might learn tidings if he is still alive."</p>

<p>"I remember the boy," the Dane answered. "And
surely 't was a hard thing that was done to him by
Hungwar and Hubba, for they sold him as a slave,
though he was a king's son; and I have heard that his
master took him to the land of the Anglo Saxons, though
in what part of that land he dwells, if he be still alive,
is more than I can tell."</p>

<p>"I thank thee for thy words, Wahrmund," answered
Wulnoth, "and I trust thee with my story."</p>

<p>"Thou mayst trust me with it, Wanderer," answered
the Dane. "So long as thou art true while thou
dost stay with us, that is all I ask. If thou go into
battle with us, fight for us and not for our foes; and
if thou dost ever desire to depart, depart without striking
secret blow&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As to that, the rede that I follow directed me to
seek this camp and serve Regner Lodbrok; and so I
have no desire to fight for your foes or against you."</p>

<p>"Regner tarries long in Angleland," the Dane said
gloomily. "I would that he were back to lead us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>himself, for the camp is broken with so many holdas,
and there is like to be mischief done ere long."</p>

<p>"Wahrmund," said Wulnoth, "canst thou tell me
this? Dost thou know any people who worship not the
gods of the North, but One who died on a cross?"</p>

<p>"Ay, that do I. 'T is the religion of most of the
Anglo Saxons now. They have forgotten their old
faith, and turned to this strange one. Yet it is a strange
story, and one that touches the heart, Wanderer," he
went on; "and it hath wondrous power with them,
making them merciful to the foe and calm in face of
torment and death. Some of our men have put their
captives to sharp torture to make them renounce this
God of theirs; but I have not known one succeed. They
have killed their victims, but in dying the Christians&mdash;for
so they call themselves&mdash;have sung songs of triumph.
They are men indeed who can fight, and suffer,
and die, and yet this creed is the creed of a nithing.
'T is beyond my poor wits, who know nothing of aught
save the storm-sea and the sword-song."</p>

<p>"And this religion is in Angleland, and Guthred
is in Angleland, and Regner Lodbrok is in Angleland
also! 'T is strange. It points to my going there also";
and Wulnoth was silent, and mused on what he heard.</p>

<p>Then said Wahrmund, pointing out to the water:
"What ship is this which comes speeding towards the
land? Let us go down and see who these may be who
come over the swan-bath thus."</p>

<p>So down to the shore they went, and the ship drew
near; and it was but a small one, with a few rowers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>and no shields hung on its sides; and yet as Wahrmund
looked he started and cried&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now here are evil tidings; for of a surety yonder
man at the helm is Bern, and Bern was the man of
Regner Lodbrok."</p>

<p>Then the boat reached the land, and the men laid
aside their oars and came ashore, and stood with drooping
heads, as those who carried heavy tidings; and the
viking cried&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, thou who art Bern, man of Regner Lodbrok,
why comest thou thus, as they that flee in battle? and
where is thy master, our Holda?"</p>

<p>"With those who feast in Walhalla," answered the
seaman. "Lead me to Hungwar, or to his noble
brother, for I have heavy tidings to tell; and the soul
of Regner Lodbrok calls aloud for vengeance, for the
nithing deed and the shame deed that were done to
him."</p>

<p>"Now, by Thor," cried Wahrmund, "he will not
cry in vain; for, if aught of wrong hath been done to
Regner the son of Sigurd, the vikings will have a song
to sing and a fire to light"; and, with that, Wahrmund
turned and guided the man to the vikings' hall; and
Wulnoth followed to hear what had befallen Regner
Lodbrok.</p>

<p>And in the hall the holdas feasted; only some
looked weary, for their souls hungered for the man's
game, and they tired of tarrying on land; and when
Hungwar saw Wahrmund enter, he cried&mdash;</p>

<p>"Greeting, Wahrmund! Whom dost thou bring,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>and why dost thou turn thy spear head down, as if evil
had come to some?"</p>

<p>"Evil hath come, Hungwar," answered Wahrmund.
"This man is Bern, who sailed with thy mighty father,
and he hath ill news to tell to thee, O jarl." And then
the chiefs looked up, and all voices were hushed; for
they knew that the death-song had been sung for Regner
Lodbrok, the old sea-king.</p>

<p>And then Hungwar said, while Hubba sat silent by
his side&mdash;</p>

<p>"So the son of Sigurd is dead, and the death-song
hath been sung. Then I will warrant that he died as
a mighty hero, and that his sword sang merrily ere he
fell, and the Valkyrs were busy. Is it not so, silent one?
Speak and tell thy tale, lest I open thy lips with a
touch of fire."</p>

<p>"I will tell my tale, Hungwar son of Regner," the
man answered. "But it is a heavy one, and the telling
of it is hard. No hero death did Regner die, but such
a death as a nithing would have deserved; and yet he
died a hero, and sang his death-song. By treachery and
falsehood was he conquered, O Hungwar, and for vengeance
does he cry to thee and to all thy people."</p>

<p>"Tell thy story, man," answered Hungwar grimly,
"and be sure that the son of Sigurd shall not cry in
vain. Truly, our swords are weary of idleness and our
ships yearn for the waves. Tell thy story, and tell it
true, all of it, neither more nor less."</p>

<p>"I obey thee," answered the man; and this is the
story that he told. Eastward to Angleland had Regner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>Lodbrok sailed, with only a few men, chiefs of fame,
for they had not meant to tarry in the land, but to see
for themselves if it was a good land and fair, and worth
the attacking. And on the eastern coast a great storm
had come, and driven them on shore, so that the ship
was wrecked and only a few escaped death. They were
in the land of the East Angles, whereover one Edmund
is king; and he at first received Regner and his companions
with friendship, and gave them gifts.</p>

<p>Yet some of the people murmured because of the
Danes being there; and Regner heard how in the north
dwelt one Ella King of Northumbria, who was himself
of Danish blood; and thither to greet him Regner went.
But Ella liked not the coming of the stranger; for the
Danes, who had settled in the north and taken possession
of the land, desired that no more of their numbers
should come to share the prize with them. So this
Ella, though he received Regner with soft speech, yet
purposed to do him harm, and plotted to take his life;
yet in what manner to do so he did not know.</p>

<p>Now the King had built him a high tower, called
Ella's Tower, and beneath this tower was a dungeon
dark and drear; and into this dungeon did King Ella
cause a number of deadly vipers to be let loose&mdash;for
he had a mind to shame Regner Lodbrok as well as
slay him, because that this Regner boasted, and made
much of his having slain the dragon and rescued Thora
the Fair from its power.</p>

<p>So when Regner and his friends sat at feasting, the
soldiers of the King of Northumbria came upon them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>and put them to the sword; but Regner they took and
bound, and cast into the vipers' tower, bidding him,
since he had slain the dragon, slay also the snakes, which
were less than the dragon. And the vipers bit the old
sea-king deep and sore, so that he knew that his death
was nigh, and none were there to sing his death-song.</p>

<p>And alone in the dungeon, with the biting vipers,
Regner Lodbrok sang his own death-song; and the
name thereof is Krakamal; and that song is known to
this day amongst the sagas of the Northland; and that
song he sang, while the darkness gathered, and the
Valkyrs carried his spirit to Walhalla.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Such was the tale that the messenger told in the
hall of the sea-kings; and when the story was finished
there was silence for a short space, and then uprose
Hungwar, and Hubba rose and stood by his side, and
Hungwar spoke and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, holdas of Denmark, ye have heard this story,
and it is a shame tale; and the spirit of the son of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>Sigurd calls to my brother and to me, and bids us take
vengeance on his foes. Now, those who list come, and
those who will tarry, tarry; but, as for Hubba and me,
we will cross the Westarweg and carry fire and sword
into Angleland; and from south to north will we harry
it. Now, viking lords, and sea-kings, who comes with
us?"</p>

<p>Then did all there start to their feet, and then did
their great swords flash out, as they cried Skoal to the
memory of Regner Lodbrok; and with one mighty
voice they answered and cried&mdash;</p>

<p>"We will come, sons of Regner. We will man our
ships and come; and from south to north we will follow
the footsteps of Regner Lodbrok, and leave a pathway
of ashes and death; and then will we take this land for
our own. But as for Ella, King of Northumbria, better
for him that he had never lived, than that he fall into
our hands. For each sting that the son of Sigurd received,
he shall receive a thousand pains."</p>

<p>Then all was bustle and hurry in the realm; and
each lord went his way to summon his own men, and
to make ready his long ships; so that never before in
all the land was so vast a fleet prepared, nor so great an
army gathered, and in no history is there a full list of
names of all the sea-kings who sailed to Angleland at
that time.</p>

<p>There were Frena, and Guthrun, and Sidric the
elder, and Sidric the younger, and Hungwar and Hubba,
all jarls of fame. And there were Kings Godron and
Halfdane, and Bacseg, and Hamond, and Oskettle&mdash;five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>kings of might; and Biorn Ironsides and many champions,
so that one knows not all their names. And with
them came many young warriors, the sons of holdas,
seeking to make a name, and many old vikings who had
spent their lives on the sea, and whose play was the
man's game; and landless men, and nameless men, who
had joined the vikings to seek their fortunes in land
afar.</p>

<p>Never was such a scene; never did so many long
ships lie like black snakes on the water; never did so
many shields gleam like suns, as the light played upon
them.</p>

<p>And in Hungwar's own ship they placed the great
banner of Regner Lodbrok, which his daughters had
woven and made in the space of one noontide; and
thereon was the Raven of Odin, worked in cunning
work; and it stretched its wings and stood erect, and
all men shouted that the omen was good, and that victory
would be theirs.</p>

<p>For this banner was supposed to be of wondrous
might; and if defeat was to come then the raven's
wings drooped and its head hung; but if victory was
to be their portion, then its wings were raised, and it
stood defiant.</p>

<p>Such was the story; though whether any man ever
saw the bird change cannot be told. Yet afterwards, as
you shall presently hear, the men of Wessex took that
banner and slew Hubba, and still the raven's wings
were spread and its head raised; so perchance the power
of the magic spell had fled from its folds.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>
<p>And then all the war-horns blared, and all the sails
were hoisted, and out over the dark, rolling sea the
rovers sailed; so that the ships were as many as the
forest leaves on the stream when the wind blows among
the trees.</p>

<p>And some sailed for Northumbria and some went
south to Wessex, and some shaped their course to land
in Mercia; but Hungwar and Hubba and those who
followed with him sailed on towards East Anglia, where
their father, Regner Lodbrok, had landed at the first;
and over the ship the great raven banner streamed, and
around the seamews circled and screamed; and the
wind blew the salt foam into their faces. Yet on and
on they went, until, far ahead, they saw the land lying
like a cloud upon the horizon; and Wahrmund pointed
towards it, and said to Wulnoth, who stood beside
him&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yonder, Wanderer, is the land to which you
desire to go. Yonder is the land of the Christians; and
it is a rich land and fat, where much spoil may be
gathered; and the people are soft and easy to conquer.
Skoal to the Angleland, and Skoal to the landing; for
heroic deeds will be done, and the man's game played
long, and the sword sing a merry song, ere we put to
sea again, and turn our faces to Denmark."</p>

<p>Then nearer and nearer the ships drew; and at last
they dropped the sails and the vikings swarmed to the
ships' sides, and there, ahead, they saw the sands, golden
yellow; and the warriors of the land drawn up to drive
them off.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>
<p>"Now," laughed Wahrmund, "why do not these
fools have good ships and come and meet us; so that
we fought on sea and kept the fire from their land?
These fools will never conquer us until they learn to
fight in ships, as we do."</p>

<p>So said Wahrmund; but little did he think that
even then there was in the land of the West Saxons a
young man, one whose face was pale and pain marked,
who pondered the same thing, and who afterwards
caused such long ships to be built, and not only beat
the Danes at their own game, but laid the foundations
of that navy, by which, in after years, this Britain of
ours has kept her proud boast and ruled the waves.</p>

<p>Now, this is how evil tidings came to Hungwar and
Hubba, and this is how Wulnoth sailed with the sea-kings
to the land of the East Angles.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />

<small><em>Of the Slaying of Edmund, the King of
the East Saxons</em></small></h2>


<p>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_121.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">T</span>hen the war-horns sounded
their harsh defiance, and the
vikings gave a great shout
of glee, and threw themselves
into the shallow
water, and rushed to meet
the Saxons, who also ran to
drive them back.</p>

<p>And the battle was
fierce, and great deeds were
done; and from least to greatest every man was a hero.
Yet the fight was with the Danes; and when the evening
came the conquered Saxons broke and fled, and the
sons of Regner encamped with their men on the field of
slaughter not far from the coast.</p>

<p>And what happened in East Anglia happened elsewhere
also; for the people of Angleland were divided
amongst themselves, and one king warred with another,
and each was jealous of his neighbor; so that they
were like a bundle of sticks when the binding is broken,
and each fell away from the rest. But the Danes came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>in mighty hosts, and if one host was beaten then two
came in its place; and all through the land they carried
fire and sword and death.</p>

<p>For these Danes were cruel and terrible, and knew
nothing of mercy; and neither youth, nor age, nor
weakness appealed to them. The young and the old
they slew, and the fair maiden, and the old wife; and
they took the tender babes and beat out their brains,
or cast them from one to the other upon their spears.
Death, and death alone, marked out the pathway which
they had trod.</p>

<p>Nor was this done in Angleland alone, but in every
country where the White Christ was worshipped. For
these Danes were pagans, and they looked upon those
who had forgotten the old gods of the North as nithings
fit only for death, and despised them for the Lord they
worshipped, and for the priests they obeyed; and they
had sworn that they would sweep over the whole world,
and wherever the worship of the Christ was found,
there they would stamp it out, and make all men bow to
Odin and swear by Thor&mdash;the gods of the North.</p>

<p>And near to doing this they were in Angleland and,
indeed, they would have done it but for one man, who
was strong enough and patient enough to resist them;
and of that man Gyso the Gleeman speaks in his song
of Wulnoth.</p>

<p>Twenty thousand chosen warriors were in the camp
of the sons of Regner that night, and deep they drank
and well they feasted; yet the sentinels kept ward, and
each man slept with his weapons by his side.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>
<p>And Wahrmund and Wulnoth lay side by side by
the fire, and talked of the deeds that had been done that
day; and from the distance, through the night air, and
above the sound of the sea, there came the ringing of a
deep-voiced bell and, faint and sweet, the singing of a
solemn song; and Wulnoth asked his companion what
these strange sounds might mean.</p>

<p>"'T is the calling of the Christians to prayer," the
Dane said carelessly. "And the song you hear is that
which they sing to their God, that He may give them
the victory on the morrow. By Thor, I had rather trust
to a good sword and to a strong arm than to any god
that rides the storm wind."</p>

<p>"Yet these men fought well to-day, comrade," Wulnoth
answered; "though they were few in numbers,
compared to our host."</p>

<p>"Ay, they fought well," replied Wahrmund. "But
now let us sleep, for there will be work to do when the
day dawns. The air is shrewd to-night."</p>

<p>"Take my cloak," answered Wulnoth. "For I
have no mind for sleep, and will watch by the
fire."</p>

<p>"More fool you," replied the other; yet he took
the cloak and wrapped himself up and was soon asleep,
while Wulnoth sat listening to the distant song, and
wondering where Guthred could be and what could have
become of Edgiva the Beautiful.</p>

<p>And then he arose and went to the edge of the
wood and listened again; and he thought that surely
Wyborga the Wise had been wrong, for how could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>this Lord, Whom the Saxons worshipped, be strong,
when He let His people be put to the sword?</p>

<p>And while he mused thus, sleep began to steal upon
his eyes, until it seemed to him that a voice spoke, and
it was the voice of Edgiva crying to him to awake;
and he opened his eyes and saw a man's form bending
over his comrade Wahrmund, and holding a knife high
in the air.</p>

<p>"Wahrmund, awake!" he cried, in warning, and
the man started up. But then like a flash Wulnoth cast
his spear and smote the midnight wanderer fair in the
chest, and he fell back dead.</p>

<p>And Wahrmund started to his feet, and others of
the soldiers, and looked to see who this might be; and
lo, it was Wiglaf the Boxer, the man of Jarl Hungwar!</p>

<p>"That knife was meant for thee, Wanderer," Wahrmund
said; "and I, by wearing thy cloak, came nigh
to getting it in my ribs. I owe my life to thee, Wanderer,
and I shall not forget it."</p>

<p>Then when the morning broke, the war-horns
sounded and the men prepared for battle; and the
great ships, with their crews, stood off to go back to
Denmark; and the vikings laughed and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"There is no going back now. Go forward we
must; and if we conquer not, then we perish."</p>

<p>And it was told to Hungwar concerning Wiglaf,
and he laughed darkly, and said that Wiglaf was ever
good at paying his debts, and that he was a good man
slain; but he said nothing of the shame of the nithing's
deed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>
<p>Now in the morning came messengers to the Danish
camp, saying that they were sent by Edmund, the
King of East Anglia, to demand why strangers came
to his country with fire and sword, and what was the
cause of quarrel between them.</p>

<p>"King Edmund seeks not war," they said. "So
now either give hostages that you will dwell peaceably
during your stay, or else begone."</p>

<p>Then loud and long laughed the viking chiefs; and
Hungwar answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"This Edmund of thine will treat us as churlishly
as he did the son of Sigurd! Now go and bid
him come and do homage to us. And tell him to pull
down his churches, and to scourge his priests away
and to worship Thor; or, by Odin and his friends,
there shall be ruin and death in all the land; and
what we have done elsewhere, that will we also do
here."</p>

<p>And then Hubba spake, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"This Edmund desires hostages, and hostages shall
he have"; and he commanded that the heads of all the
messengers save one should be struck off and put in a
sack. Then he cut off the ears of the last one and bade
him go back and give the heads to his king, as a present
from the sea-kings, and tell him that so he would be
served, if he gave not up his false god.</p>

<p>But the Saxon was noble and brave; and, though
he was alone and in sore pain, and the vikings all
around, he cast the shame in Hubba's teeth, and he said
that neither the King nor his subjects would worship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>pagan gods or turn from the Lord Christ, let what
would follow.</p>

<p>"Drive him from the camp," said Hubba; and the
brave messenger was scourged away, amidst the vikings'
laughter.</p>

<p>But Wulnoth did not laugh, for his soul was heavy
and his heart troubled; for it seemed to him that this
was a shame deed to slay messengers who did but their
duty; and he could not but think that the Saxon who
had thus answered seemed nobler and grander than the
mightiest of the vikings.</p>

<p>Then the Danes put the battle in order, and they
marched inland; and on the next day they saw the
army of the East Saxons drawn up, and they waved
their weapons, and cried in joy&mdash;</p>

<p>"Greeting, worshippers of the White Christ. Let
Him fight for you this day, for you need aid."</p>

<p>But the Saxons answered not; only as their priests
passed along their ranks they bowed their heads in
prayer, while the Danes mocked.</p>

<p>Then the battle commenced, and the slingers cast
their stones, and the archers sped their arrows, and
the light spears whistled as they were hurled; and
then the ranks of the warriors closed, and the sword
sang, and the shield received the blow, and fierce the
fight raged; but still the Danes were victorious, and
drove the forces of the Saxons back, so that they were
scattered like the leaves before the wind; and at last
King Edmund himself took to flight, while the vikings,
with many shouts, spread over the land, slaying all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>whom they found and sending the red flames through
many a roof.</p>

<p>And some chosen warriors pursued the King, and
Wulnoth was amongst the number; and so hard did
they press him that, at last, he sprang from his horse
and sped down the bank of a stream, and hid beneath
a bridge, hoping that the foe would pass on without
seeing him.</p>

<p>And now happened a sad thing for Edmund the
King; for there came a young man and his wife, and
they had but been married that day; and as they
crossed the bridge, seeking to escape from the Danes
who were everywhere, they espied the moonlight shining
on the golden spurs of the King; and the man crept
down and saw who thus lay in the water; but the man
was a nithing who knew no shame.</p>

<p>For the King made him swear that he would not
betray his hiding-place; but the man and his wife fell
in with the pirates, and they were seized and brought
before Hungwar who questioned them, whether they
had seen the King; and the man, to save his life and the
life of his wife, led them to the place where King Edmund
lay hidden, and there the Danes caught him and
made him prisoner.</p>

<p>And the King when he knew who had betrayed him
spoke, and laid a curse on the bridge, and said that
whoever crossed it to get married should have that
curse fall on their shoulders.</p>

<p>But the man who had betrayed the King did not
escape, for Hungwar ordered both him and his wife to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>be slain&mdash;so little was the word of the viking to be
trusted.</p>

<p>Then the Danes carried King Edmund back to their
camp, and heavy chains were placed upon his arms and
legs, though he was a king; and he was placed in the
holdas' hall, where the chief jarls and the kings gathered;
and there they made mock of him and laughed
him to scorn, and asked him where was his Christ in
Whom he trusted?</p>

<p>And Wulnoth was there, leaning on his spear nigh
the door; and he looked upon the face of the King
standing there amidst his foes, and thought how calm
and noble he looked.</p>

<p>For this Edmund had the blue eyes of the Saxon,
and the long yellow hair that Wulnoth remembered so
well; and his mien was lofty and calm, and his manner
that of one who feared no death, though he grieved for
the loss of his people.</p>

<p>And when they asked him where his Lord was,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
Edmund the King looked up and smiled, and his smile
was one of peace, and he pointed to the sky and made
answer&mdash;</p>

<p>"There, in His glory, sits the Lord," he said, "and
He alone is God"; and at that Hungwar cast his glove
and smote him in the face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thy God cannot deliver thee from even that; and
how shall He deliver thee from our wrath?" he shouted.
"Now, Edmund, who wast king of this land, I am minded
to spare thy life on certain conditions. First, thou shalt
strip all thine altars and cast them down, and give
the gold to me; and if thou do it not, then be sure
that I shall. Then shalt thou do homage to me here
in my camp, and call me thy overlord; and, lastly, thou
shalt sing a song to Odin and to Thor, and to the gods
which were worshipped from of old by the people of
the North. How sayest thou?"</p>

<p>"Thus do I say, O Hungwar," answered the King
calmly. "I will do none of these things. I will not
give thee the gold from God's altar; and be thou sure
that though He holds me unworthy to guard His house,
He will find a champion to do so. I will not call thee
my king; and I will not worship Thor or any false gods,
for there is one God alone, and the Lord Christ is His
Son."</p>

<p>"Now," thought Wulnoth, "this man is mad; for
what does it matter what god a man calls on so long
as he saves his life?" Yet, for all that, he thought it
shame that his captors should treat the King so.</p>

<p>But that was not the worst that the Danes did to
Edmund of East Anglia; for, after his words, they led
him out into the midst of the camp, and, though he was
a king, they beat him and scourged him with whips
till the flesh was torn and the blood flowed; and then
they asked him whether he would deny his Lord and
worship Odin as Hungwar ordered. But the King
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>spoke, and his voice was heavy with pain, but his reply
was without hesitation&mdash;</p>

<p>"My Lord was scourged for my sins," he said,
"and I will be scourged for His sake, and rejoice that
it is so."</p>

<p>"Now," thought Wulnoth, "this beating of a brave
man is a nithing deed, and these Danes are but as ravening
beasts, while this is a man indeed." Yet he was
powerless to do aught, for he was one amongst twenty
thousand.</p>

<p>And when the reply of the tortured King was heard,
then Hungwar added torture to torture. And they
twisted his chains and placed sticks beneath the links,
until the flesh was all bruised and the bones broke;
yet still the King would give no answer, but that he
bore all for his Lord's sake.</p>

<p>"Surely the man is a fool," growled Wahrmund;
"for why else would he bear this torture?" But Wulnoth
answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"Surely the man is a hero, and he defies his
enemies and will not let them triumph over him; while,
as for these holdas who stand by and see a man put to
such shame, I think little of them."</p>

<p>"Thou hadst best say less than thou thinkest,
then," said Wahrmund significantly, "or we may have
thee taking thy place beside yonder tortured man."</p>

<p>"Is there no pain can wring consent from thee?"
said Hungwar darkly when again he knew that King
Edmund had defied him; and the King answered him
bravely&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>
<p>"There is no pain shall make me deny my Lord."</p>

<p>"Now be not foolish, man," cried Guthrun, who
liked not this sport. "A word will save thee." But
the King answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"That word I will never speak."</p>

<p>Then Hungwar the Dane gave command, and they
carried King Edmund out and tied him to a great tree;
and the vikings took their bows and their casting
spears and made him their target; and the task was to
wound the King and bring blood with each arrow or
spear cast, yet not to hurt him so that his life would be
endangered.</p>

<p>From the morn till the afternoon did they thus torture
him, until his poor body was so cut and marred
that it could not be seen for wounds and blood; and
the King's head drooped, and his eyes closed from
weariness and pain.</p>

<p>Now Wulnoth stood near the King, and he was
filled with wonder, and with pity, and with disgust that
a brave man should be so treated; and when the vikings
rested from their sport he drew near, and he said in
low tones&mdash;</p>

<p>"Listen to me, O King. Save thee I cannot; but
I can make an end for thee. I will stand and cast my
spear, and I will take care that it pierces thy heart, and
so sleep shall come to thee."</p>

<p>But the King lifted his head, and opened his patient
eyes, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Nay, friend. I know that to do this would cost
thee thy right hand; and for me the end is not far off,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>and I can be patient. My Lord was smitten with a spear
for me, and I will suffer the spear for His glory; He
Who is stronger than the strongest will strengthen me;
and from my death will good come, for the Holy Church
is watered with the blood of her sons."</p>

<p>Now all this was as a dark saying to Wulnoth, and
he could make nothing of it. Only he knew that this
man, who was now no more a king, and who was now
nigh to death, had something which he possessed not,
something which made him grand and glorious, and
strong even in weakness, and patient in suffering; and
the King looked at him again, and spoke once more&mdash;</p>

<p>"Seek thou unto Him, friend," he said. "For He
giveth peace and joy for sorrow and labor, and with
Him death's darkness turneth to light."</p>

<p>And then Wulnoth looked again, and he saw that
around the King's neck a little cross hung. And the
King asked him to lift it to his lips that he might kiss
it ere he died, and Wulnoth, wondering and fearing,
obeyed.</p>

<p>Then from his hall came Hungwar, and with him
came Biorn Ironsides, and Sidroc, and Frena, and many
jarls, and he stood before the King and asked him
again whether he would agree to worship Odin and
deny the White Christ.</p>

<p>But the King opened his eyes again, and he said
calmly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Trouble me no more, Hungwar, son of Regner.
Thou hast done thy worst, and thou hast had thy pleasure,
and I have borne in silence. Now make an end and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>trouble me no more, for, had I fifty lives, and each
could take a lifetime in dying, I still would not do this
thing which thou dost command, thou bloodthirsty and
wicked pirate of the Northland."</p>

<p>Then Hungwar stamped his foot, and he dashed
his fist in the calm face, and he ordered his men to take
the King and smite off his head.</p>

<p>For Hungwar was weary of seeing King Edmund
resist, and moreover some of the Danish holdas who
were more noble of heart than he, said that this was a
shame deed which was being done in their midst, while
Guthrun said openly that though he loved to slay a man
in fair fight, he had no love for serving a hero shamefully,
and that if Hungwar liked not his words then they
two would go hold holmgang together.</p>

<p>But that was no part of Hungwar's plans. He had
no wish to have his force divided and quarrelling as
did the Saxons, and so he gave the word; and Wulnoth
was amongst those who saw the King die.</p>

<p>"You are to die," they told him, and King Edmund
answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"To die is to live again."</p>

<p>Then they smote off his head, and so sleep came for
the King of the East Saxons.</p>

<p>Now, this is how the Danes beat the men of East
Anglia, and put their king to the torture.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />

<small><em>How Wulnoth met with Wyborga again</em></small></h2>


<p>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_134.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">N</span>ow after the slaying of
Edmund the King, the
Danes cast his body into a
field as though it were but
the body of some base-born
slave, and even those who
had cried shame forgot all
about it, and went back to
their feasting; for what
was one foe more or less?
And as to burying the body, the viking lords were too
busy slaying to think of burying, and the dogs and the
crows would soon make an end of the corpse.</p>

<p>But the heart of Wulnoth was heavy within him at
this murder, for so he felt it was, and he thought within
himself that these Danes were ill masters to serve.
Yet he would not leave them, because he knew not whom
else to follow, and also because he felt in his heart that
there was a matter yet to be settled between Hungwar
and himself; and moreover, unless he tarried, how
should he ever learn the fate of Guthred his friend?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>
<p>Now that night all over the land there shone the
glare of flames, telling of the work which was being
done by the Danish bands, but in the camp the leaders
stayed and feasted.</p>

<p>Some were for pushing on at once, but Hungwar
was too cunning for that, and he said that it was ill to
put too great a distance between themselves and the
sea until their ships returned with more of their men,
seeing that they were safe where they were.</p>

<p>"The army of the East Saxons is destroyed," he
said, "and will not come against us again; therefore
here will we abide for the time, and the people shall serve
us, and presently we will march into Mercia and join
our brethren there."</p>

<p>Most agreed to this, but some grumbled, and in
the end left Hungwar and marched inland, and amongst
these was Hubba, but that was not yet.</p>

<p>Now on the night of the killing of the King, Wulnoth
took his spear in his hand, and, with his sword
by his side, he wandered into the darkness, for his mind
was full of restless thoughts, and he cared not whither
his feet bore him.</p>

<p>And as he went he thought of Wyborga and the
little cross she had made, and the wonder tale which
Edgiva had told him, and of the way in which the King
had died for his Lord; and he wondered also whether
the tales of the gods of the Northland were true tales
or false, and he wondered whither he must go to seek
the strongest and the mightiest lord, now that old Regner
Lodbrok was dead.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>
<p>And as he wandered he came to a wood, and he
entered its darkness and solitude, for he had little fear
of meeting any foe, all having fled far from the Danes,
and only the churls remaining, and they would be more
afraid of him than he need be of them.</p>

<p>It was quiet here, and reminded him of the woods
in distant Lethra, where he had walked with Edgiva
the Beautiful in the happy days. And the Danes had
destroyed Lethra and laid it in ruins&mdash;and yet he was
serving with the Danes! Wulnoth shook his spear at
that thought, and he said aloud&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yet for the while I will tarry, and presently I will
speak a word with the sons of Regner for the deeds
they have done to those dear to me, and then shall
Hungwar know who the Wanderer is and why he has
joined him."</p>

<p>And then he paused and stared in wonder, thinking
that some night hag must be playing with him, for
from the darkness came the voice of Edgiva the Beautiful,
and it said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Greeting, Wanderer, who wast called Wulnoth!"</p>

<p>"Who art thou who callest to me with the voice
of my Princess?" he cried. "Whoever thou art, good
or evil, show thyself I command thee by the name of
Thor."</p>

<p>"Little care I for that name, Wanderer," the voice
answered, and then there was silence, and he called
again and again, but without success.</p>

<p>Then just as he would have turned back, another
voice spoke and said&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>
<p>"Greeting, Wulnoth!" and this time he made out
a figure coming towards him. And he sprang forward
and caught at it, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now who art thou who walkest by night and
callest greeting to me?"</p>

<p>"One whom thou hast known as a friend, Wulnoth,"
came the reply, and Wulnoth knew the voice
then for that of Wyborga the Wise, and he cried,
trembling with eagerness&mdash;</p>

<p>"O Wyborga, is it thou? How dost thou come into
this land? Then I was not deceived when I thought
that my Princess spoke to me not long since! O
Wyborga, lead me to her, for I have sought her with
a long and weary seeking, and my heart failed me at
last."</p>

<p>But Wyborga answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, Wulnoth, for it has already been told to thee
that you two will not meet again to abide until thou
hast learnt the wonder tale, which thou hast till now
rejected."</p>

<p>"The story of the White Christ?" said Wulnoth.
"Oh, Wyborga, I have heard that tale, but it seems to
me an idle saga and fit for nithings."</p>

<p>"Wulnoth," said Wyborga gravely, "there was
one in yonder camp of murderers who was not a nithing,
and yet who believed in that tale."</p>

<p>"The Saxon King!" he said. "Ah, Wyborga, I
dare not ask thee how thou dost know that, for thou
knowest so many things, thou woman of mystery. But
this I say&mdash;that King was a brave man, and they who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>put him to shame are cowards even though they are
brave in the war game."</p>

<p>"Tell me how he died, Wulnoth," said Wyborga.
"Tell me all." And he obeyed, while Wyborga listened
with bent head and with many a sigh.</p>

<p>"So does the Lord desire of His people," she said
when he finished, "and so does Edmund gain a better
crown than the golden one of earth."</p>

<p>"I understand not your words," Wulnoth made
answer. "They are still dark with mystery&mdash;all the
world is a puzzle to me now, and where to seek for
Guthred the Prince I know not. Cannot you speak
clearly to me, Wyborga?"</p>

<p>"Edgiva spoke clearly, Wulnoth, but you could not
understand her tale."</p>

<p>"But that was of the White Christ," he cried.
"Does everything refer to Him?" And Wyborga said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Everything is to Him."</p>

<p>Then there was silence for a space, and Wulnoth
spoke again and asked of Edgiva; and Wyborga made
reply and inquired whether he would like to see her.</p>

<p>"To see Edgiva, O Wyborga!" he cried. "I would
do anything to see my Princess again." And Wyborga
nodded.</p>

<p>"Now I will test thee, Wulnoth, and there shall
be nothing of dishonor in my request. Tell me first,
where is the body of the King?"</p>

<p>This Wulnoth told to her, and then Wyborga
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now listen, Wulnoth. Thou art to stand here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>without moving, and there will come to thee a man.
Him thou must lead stealthily into the camp, and if
any meet thee, thou must pass him off as a companion.
Canst thou do this?"</p>

<p>"Easily can it be done, Wyborga, for the camp is
feasting now, and only the watchers are at their posts."</p>

<p>"That is good, then," the wise woman replied.
"Now thou must guide this man, asking no questions,
to the place where the dead King is thrown, and thou
must help him to bear the body without the camp.
Wilt thou do this?"</p>

<p>"Yea, Wyborga, for there is no harm in it; and if,
as I suppose, this man is the King's man, seeking to do
honor to the dead, then will I gladly do it. But how
may I see Edgiva?"</p>

<p>"When thy work is done the reward shall be sure,
Wulnoth. The man who will go with thee will tell
thee how and when thou shalt see the Princess."</p>

<p>But then an angry suspicion came to Wulnoth, and
he cried&mdash;</p>

<p>"O Wyborga, of old the Princess told me that she
had a Lord. Now is this man her lord, or was the dead
King her lord, that she is in his country?"</p>

<p>"Set thy heart at rest, Wulnoth," replied Wyborga.
"Edgiva's Lord is the Lord for Whose honor the King
died. Thou art hasty and foolish, and therefore trouble
has been thine. Be patient now, and remember that
as of old, I am thy friend."</p>

<p>"I will trust you, Wyborga," Wulnoth answered.</p>

<p>And then Wyborga called softly thrice, like the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>cry of the wood owl, and a step sounded, and through
the bushes a man came and greeted Wyborga.</p>

<p>"Thou hast called, good mother," he said. "Then
thy mission is successful, and thou hast found some
one who can guide me, and who will help me?"</p>

<p>"I have found some one," answered Wyborga, and
then again she turned to Wulnoth and addressed him
by his name of Wanderer.</p>

<p>"Wanderer, this is the man I spoke of; and were
it not that I know thee to be brave and true, I would
not have trusted thee, for though thou knowest it not,
thou hast a great treasure&mdash;ay, the hope of this land
in thy hand. Wanderer, guard this man as thou wouldst
guard thine own life&mdash;nay, more closely even, for thy
life thou wouldst risk, but this man's life thou must not
risk. Only because a holy duty is to be done shall this
danger be run."</p>

<p>"Now," thought Wulnoth, "this must be some
son of the dead King who will seek to reign in his
stead. But that matters not. I will guide him and
so shall I see my Princess again, and if any try to
hinder me, well, it will mean hard blows will be
given."</p>

<p>Then he loosened his sword in its sheath, and he
turned to the man, saying simply&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come with me, stranger, and tread boldly. To
do otherwise might be to make suspicion. Thou art one
of the soldiers returning with me, and thou must laugh
and sing and be merry; so shall we pass through the
camp without fear."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>
<p>"Atheling!" cried Wyborga in alarm. And Wulnoth
thought to himself&mdash;</p>

<p>"So I am right! We have a prince here," for so
the word meant in the Saxon.</p>

<p>But the man laughed and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Have no fear, my good mother, for the way this
good man advises is the best. 'T is often safer when we
wish to hide something to place it where all may see it,
and the best disguise may be to appear to desire to be
seen. Come, Wanderer, since so you are called, and we
will go about our work."</p>

<p>"I am ready," answered Wulnoth. "Farewell,
Wyborga, and greet me to my Princess. 'T is for her
that I undertake this work to-night."</p>

<p>"Thy Princess greets thee, Wulnoth, but not in
the name of Thor."</p>

<p>It was Edgiva's voice again! Then she was somewhere
near at hand, hidden in the darkness of the forest.
Wulnoth stopped, but the voice spoke again, bidding
him hasten to his task, and so, muttering to himself
that all this was too deep for him to understand, Wulnoth
accompanied the stranger from the wood towards
the Danish camp.</p>

<p>And when they drew near to it he said to the
other&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now there is much danger here. Shall I go by
myself and bear the body out to you?"</p>

<p>"Nay, friend," came the quiet answer. "I have
faced danger before. Do thou lead the way and I will
follow."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>
<p>"So be it," answered Wulnoth, and they went in,
passing the guard who, knowing Wulnoth, took no
notice of his companion.</p>

<p>There was little to fear. The Danes knew that
no foe was near, for their bands had come in with the
report that they had driven the East Saxons far afield,
and now all were resting from the labor, and telling
their tales of the fight, and but few were away from the
camp fires.</p>

<p>So on the two went, talking as though they were
friends, and the stranger acted his part well and laughed
as though he had been in the war game himself, though
when they passed a watch fire Wulnoth noted that his
face was stern and his eyes gleamed, and he thought
that presently this man would indeed be in the war game
and avenge the story of that day's fight.</p>

<p>A young man was he and without the girth and
strength of the viking men. But his face was noble
and his brow high, and a crisp red-brown beard graced
his mouth and chin.</p>

<p>So they reached the place where the body of the
dead King had been thrown, and lo, a man stood there
guarding it, and at sight of that Wulnoth gripped his
sword.</p>

<p>But the man rose and spoke, and it was Wahrmund's
voice, and he asked who they were and what
they did there; and to him Wulnoth answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wahrmund," he said, "thou art a brave man
who loves not to see a hero put to shame."</p>

<p>"And for that cause am I here, Wanderer," the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>Dane replied. "For there was a sneaking wolf howled,
and methought that so brave a man should not become
wolf's food. Therefore, to-night I watch, and to-morrow
will I bury the body of this hero, so deep that no wolf
can dig it up."</p>

<p>"Wahrmund, there be others who would bury the
body of this man with the honor due to a fallen hero,"
Wulnoth made reply, "and I have such a one with me.
We come to carry this body without the camp, that it
may be given honor and have a death-song sung."</p>

<p>"And thou hast brought a stranger within the
camp, Wanderer," was the stern retort. "That is not
right."</p>

<p>"Then to-morrow let me pay for it, if you think
it wrong, comrade. But for the sake of a brave man
who died well, let him now take the King's body
away."</p>

<p>Then gruff old Wahrmund smote his spear into the
ground and swore a lusty oath.</p>

<p>"Now, Wanderer, my mind misgives me that we
two are doing that for which our heads may leave our
bodies," he growled, "but still it shall be done. So
lend me thy aid and we will lift this hero from his
humble bed and bear him away."</p>

<p>"I knew that thou wert a true comrade, Wahrmund,"
said Wulnoth. But the Dane answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"I knew that thou wert a fool, Wanderer; and
thou dost make me one, and, by Thor, perhaps I love
thee the better for the doing of it."</p>

<p>Reverently did the young stranger take the severed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>head from Wulnoth; and he bowed his head for the
moment over it, while the other two lifted their heavy
burden.</p>

<p>"Now, how shall we bear this through the camp?"
mused Wulnoth. And his friend answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"We will not bear it through the camp; we will
cross from here to the forest. There are no sentries
on this side that I know."</p>

<p>And so quietly the two carried their burden, the
stranger walking beside them with the head, and when
they reached the shelter of the wood they laid the body
down and asked what next was to be done and whither
it was to be borne.</p>

<p>"Leave it here with me," answered the stranger,
"and all will be well. For you, kind foe, my best
thanks." This he said to Wahrmund, who growled
again, feeling perhaps a little ashamed of himself that
he had been led into doing this thing; and the stranger
turned to Wulnoth&mdash;</p>

<p>"To you I am bidden to say that if you wait here
to-morrow night, about this hour, that which you
most desire shall be, and a messenger will be here to
guide you."</p>

<p>"Thou wilt give yon hero honor?" growled Wahrmund.
"He should be buried with honor." And the
stranger smiled&mdash;</p>

<p>"If thou dost want to see that, warrior, come thou
with thy friend to-morrow and see for thyself&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How do you know that you can trust me, and
how do I know that I can trust you, Saxon?" the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>Dane asked mockingly; and the Saxon answered
calmly&mdash;</p>

<p>"I can trust a man who is noble enough to watch
by the body of a shamed hero through the long night
hours."</p>

<p>"Good," said Wahrmund. "Then how may I
know that I can trust you?"</p>

<p>"You may trust me," answered the other, "because
for that which you have done I am grateful. Not
even to a foe does a true man repay kindness with ingratitude."
And again Wahrmund said, "Good."</p>

<p>"I know not who you are, stranger; but I know
you to be a true man," he said. "One day we may
meet face to face in the war game, but to-morrow night
we will meet, as thou sayest, in peace."</p>

<p>"Till then, farewell," said the stranger; and then
the two turned and went. And the stranger called like
the wood owl, and from the shadows came silent ones,
who lifted the dead King and bore him away, with
sound of weeping and lamentation.</p>

<p>Now, this is how Wulnoth met Wyborga the Wise
in the woods of East Anglia, and this is how the body
of King Edmund was carried from the camp of the
Danes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />

<small><em>How Wulnoth and Wahrmund visited
the Christian Church</em></small></h2>


<p>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_146.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">N</span>ow, on the morning after
Wulnoth had aided in the
carrying away of the King's
body, there was trouble in
the Danish camp, because
one who had gone into the
field to view the remains of
the victim of Hungwar's
cruelty found no trace left;
and this he thought strange.</p>

<p>And, though the Danes were fierce and cruel, there
were some amongst them noble enough to reverence
a brave man who could suffer in patience as King
Edmund had done; and these, like Guthrun, declared
that Hungwar's deed was a shame deed, and one to be
repented of.</p>

<p>And these, when they heard that the body was
gone, declared that this was the work of the gods, because
they were angry that the King had been slain.
And some said that they had seen the King fly up into
the clouds, borne along by the storm sisters; and others
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>declared that he had stalked through the camp, his
head in his hand, and had vanished into the forest.</p>

<p>But then, there are always people ready to fancy
that they have seen such wonders as these, and others
who will say that they have seen, even if they know
it false; so the Danish leaders shook their heads and
laughed when they heard, and said that the warriors
had drunk too deeply from their ale horns the night
before.</p>

<p>But Hungwar was troubled and angry, for he liked
not to hear such tales; and he felt, moreover, that some
treachery was abroad, or that foes had been in the
camp and taken the body away.</p>

<p>"Why trouble thy head about it?" laughed Hubba,
his brother. "The carrion is gone. The wolves have
eaten it." But to that Hungwar answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wolves leave bones, brother, and there be no
bones left here. There is treason amongst us, brother,
and woe be to the man who is guilty if I find him out."</p>

<p>"Wanderer," said Wahrmund to his friend, that
same morning, "methinks we played a daring game
last night, and methinks that if it were known to our
leaders, our tarrying in this world would be short and
painful. Art thou determined to go through with this
business to-night?"</p>

<p>"I am determined," answered Wulnoth firmly.
"But come thou not, friend, if thou art minded to keep
away. I will see this thing to the end; for there is one
I seek to see, and I will give my life in payment, if
need be."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>
<p>"Thy princess, as thou dost call her, comrade?"
laughed Wahrmund. "Ah! I know. So do a pair of
pretty eyes lead brave men to danger and death. But
hark to me, comrade"; and he lowered his voice. "I
tell thee this because I love thee for a brave man, and
because I read things quickly. There was some talk
of a beautiful child in those days when we destroyed
Lethra, and much was Hungwar angered that he could
not find her. Now, if this princess of thine be she whom
I suppose, look to it that Hungwar hear not of it, or
there will be trouble. She is not a child now, but
maiden grown; and Hungwar would not do the hunting
and leave thee to take the spoil. Look to it, Wulnoth,
for the son of Regner is crafty, as well as fierce;
and there may be trouble for thee and thy princess
yet."</p>

<p>Wulnoth thanked his friend for his counsel, and he
thought to himself that if ever things came to that pass
there would be trouble for Hungwar also; but that
thought he kept from his comrade, for Wahrmund was
of Hungwar's band, and Wulnoth would not do aught
to make him false to his oath.</p>

<p>All day long the Danes roamed, hunting and sporting;
and often, alas, hunting human game, driving,
harrying, slaying, all the unhappy churls with whom
they met, and burning their poor houses to the ground.</p>

<p>For this was the leader's counsel&mdash;"Here we must
make a stronghold," they said, "and none but our own
men must remain in the land. Then, when we have
played the war game, and driven our foes before us,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>we will make the Saxons become our thralls, and they
shall labor for us while we live at ease."</p>

<p>And, truly, in East Anglia it seemed as if this
would be; for the people had become filled with fear
and hopeless, and they thought no more of fighting
these fierce strangers, who came in swarms, as the
gnats rise from the pools, but they either fled and left
all or else came and offered service, begging for life only.</p>

<p>Now in the evening, when the shadows grew, and
the holdas gathered in their hall, and told their tales
and drank their brown ale and wine, then Wulnoth and
Wahrmund went their way towards the forest, thinking
that no man would notice their absence. But
Hungwar, as he sat with his friends, glanced with
quick suspicious eyes adown the hall, and he saw that
Wulnoth and Wahrmund were away, and he remembered
that they had been away the night before; and
he said naught, but resolved to watch them closely, for
he hated Wulnoth, he knew not why, and he knew that
Wahrmund was his friend.</p>

<p>And into the forest the friends went, spear in hand
and sword by side, for no man might go safely unless
he bore his weapons; and presently, when they came
to the place where they had parted from the stranger
the night before, a low hooting of the wood owl was
heard, and from the deep shadows a man stepped and
saluted them.</p>

<p>"Greeting, Hacos, both," he said, in low tones,
using the name by which the Saxons call a stranger
from the Northland. "Ye are to follow me."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>
<p>"Hold!" cried Wahrmund, ever a wary old soldier.
"That is all very well, my friend. But how do
we know it? We indeed came hither to meet one, but
that one you are not; and how are we to know that you
come from him and are not a foe seeking to lead us to
our doom?"</p>

<p>"The thorn-crowned cross," answered the man.
"The Wanderer will know of it."</p>

<p>"In truth I do know," cried Wulnoth. "We may
follow, Wahrmund; for if he were not sent by my
friends he would not have given me that token."</p>

<p>"Follow then," growled the Dane, shouldering his
spear, "and follow close; for, by Thor, this darkness
is such that a man might walk into the presence of his
worst foes, and be none the wiser until the sword or
knife told him of it."</p>

<p>"The way is somewhat long," the guide said
calmly. "Of that I warn you, and it is hard to tread."</p>

<p>"Little care we for that," was the answer he received.
"We have trodden no easy paths of late. Lead
on, and we follow."</p>

<p>So through the forest they went, and in the shadow
a voice challenged and their guide answered. And
thrice did this happen, showing to them that, after all,
the soldiers of East Anglia still remained in the land
and kept watch and ward over the secret paths.</p>

<p>Then they came from the woodland, and saw before
them, in the dim light, pools and streams of water
stretching all around; and the guide said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Follow closely in my steps, for there is death here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>for any who stray." And Wahrmund grunted, for he
liked not the road they trod, where the feet sank into
yielding soil at every step, and the air was full of the
croakings of frogs and the cries of night birds.</p>

<p>And here again they were challenged twice, and the
guide gave answer ere they were allowed to proceed;
and so going they came to the water's edge where,
silent and motionless, men awaited them with a boat.</p>

<p>"Ah!" grunted Wahrmund, "this is better. The
water is the viking's land, and better than those forests
or the swampy plains. Have we far to go, guide? for
methinks that time passes."</p>

<p>"You shall be safely back at your camp ere the
dawn breaks in the east," answered the guide. "Now
be silent and prepare to see sights of which you know
nothing yet."</p>

<p>The boat crossed to an island, and here they
stepped ashore, again being challenged; and then, in
the centre of the isle, which was but small, they saw
a building, surrounded by trees to screen it from the
passers-by, and here the guide paused and uttered his
cry again; and at that, from the yawning portal a man
emerged, clad in a gray robe which reached to his feet.</p>

<p>"Who are these, my son?" he asked. And the
guide replied&mdash;</p>

<p>"Those whom I was bidden bring, father. Now
I leave them in thy keeping."</p>

<p>"It is well. Follow me, friends, and be silent and
solemn; and, moreover, remember that ye go into the
presence of the Most High."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>
<p>There was something awe-inspiring in his solemn
words; and he, without awaiting their reply, led the
way into this building, passing along a low, narrow way,
arched o'erhead, and pausing at a door whereat a man
sat.</p>

<p>"Enter," he said, "and once again I pray you be
silent, and remember that it is only because the Atheling
and a royal lady have desired this, that we let your
eyes behold our worship. Enter," and stepping aside
he suffered them to go in.</p>

<p>And what a strange place it was! For the moment
their eyes seemed blinded by the light&mdash;light that
came from a hundred lamps. Then, as they grew accustomed
to the radiance, they were able to look around
and examine their surroundings.</p>

<p>It was not a very spacious apartment, but it was
very beautiful. Massive stone pillars in long rows supported
the arched roof, and the windows were ornamented
with curious carvings in stone work. But it
was not at columns, nor roof, nor at windows, that they
looked, but at the scene directly facing them, for such
a scene they had never viewed before.</p>

<p>There uprose above five stone steps a lofty altar,
draped in white and crimson and gold, and many a gem
and much precious metal in its workings; and there,
directly in front of this, was a bier, upon which rested
the body of the martyred King Edmund.</p>

<p>Calm and dignified did the royal face look in death,
and all the pain and weariness had left the features. The
hair fell on either side of the wax-like brow, upon which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>his golden crown now rested; and behind the bier,
rising over it as though it were guarding the sleeping
King, rose a cross. Ay, a cross, yet not an empty one,
for on it hung One nailed there by hands and feet.</p>

<p>All the skill of the sculptor, all the cunning of the
painter, had been expended upon that work; and as
the two rough Northmen looked, they held their breath
in awe, for the blue eyes, so gentle and yet so kingly,
seemed to glance across at them; and the whole attitude
of the Sufferer seemed to speak of infinite pity and
love, so that Wahrmund drew a deep breath and whispered
to his companion&mdash;</p>

<p>"By Thor! 'T is a god yonder. 'T is Balder the
Beautiful, who watches from yon cross, over the couch
of death!"</p>

<p>"Hush!" answered Wulnoth in the same tone&mdash;he
could not take his eyes from that figure. Without
word being spoken to him he saw what a poor blind fool
he had been. If this was the image of Him Whom the
Christians worshipped, He was no coward and nithing,
but the greatest, the grandest, the noblest of all the
sons of men.</p>

<p>Then they noticed yet another thing&mdash;the body
of the King was guarded, for on either side of the bier
a man knelt&mdash;a young man, clad in royal attire, and
upon the head of one of the two glittered a kingly
crown.</p>

<p>"Yon kneeling man is he we saw in the wood last
night&mdash;he whom we aided," whispered Wahrmund,
and Wulnoth nodded.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>
<p>But now came a sound of soft music, sweet and
strange, now sinking into a whisper, now rising into a
flood, and with it the voices of singers raising a death-song.</p>

<p>But a strange death-song, truly, for the death-songs
of the North were to the honor of the heroes and spoke
of their deeds, but this song was to the White Christ
and to the God of Heaven, and it spoke no word of
praise about the dead king, but only told of humble
trust in the Crucified One.</p>

<p>Then into the building the singers swept, all veiled
in long robes&mdash;some men, some graceful maidens,
and&mdash;</p>

<p>Wulnoth started and fixed his anxious eyes upon
one of that throng&mdash;surely he knew that voice&mdash;surely
he recognized that figure&mdash;surely beneath that robe
the beauty of Edgiva was hidden!</p>

<p>But if it was the Princess she gave no sign. The
singers slowly passed up to the altar and divided into
two parties, one on either side, and the two watchers
rose up and stood by the bier, as kingly a pair of young
men as the eye might look upon, though he whom they
had spoken with the evening before looked pale and as
if sickness had been his portion.</p>

<p>Then there came other men, priests, led by one tall
and dignified, and they sang praises to God, and offered
prayers, and spoke of the Crucified as Lord of Lords
and King of Kings. And the two watchers stood there
with hearts filled with wonder and awe, for though
they could not understand, yet there was something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>both grand and dreadful in this worship, and yet, withal,
it was winning, like the sweet scent of the flowers or
the song of the birds, or the whisper of the sea upon a
summer's day. It was something which seemed to get
into their hearts, and made them long for they knew
not what, with a longing which was sweet and painful.</p>

<p>And then the aged priest, for such they divined
the man to be, stood and spoke of the dead King and the
work which he had tried to do, and how he had been
tried and was faithful, choosing rather the tortures of
the Danes than the denying of his Lord, and how,
though he had passed through the gates of death, yet
in his Lord he lived and reigned in glory forever.</p>

<p>And then he paused and turned to the two young
men, and called them the hope of the Church, and bade
them be strong in the Lord and gird themselves for
battle.</p>

<p>"Strong are the foe and terrible," he said. "Many
as the sands of the sea and mighty as Bashan, but in
the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength, and He Who
could strengthen Gideon, and make Jephthah conquer,
shall also make you mighty. Go forward, hope of the
Church&mdash;go forward, avengers of the noble Edmund&mdash;go
forward and quit yourselves like men, and the
Lord shall give you the victory, and deliver His Church
from the powers of darkness and from the violence of
the spoiler."</p>

<p>Then the two young men knelt again, and the priest
placed his hands upon them and blessed them; and then
the men in long robes came and took up the body of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>dead King and carried it away. And in one portion of
the building was the dark entrance to an underground
vault, and into this they lowered the bier, while all there
sang hymns of victory to God for victory over death.
And this was the burying of the King of the East Saxons.</p>

<p>Then two by two the procession was formed, and,
headed by the priest, they swept all round the building,
coming nigh the spot where Wulnoth and his companion
stood in the shadow, and the eyes of Wulnoth followed
that one figure, his heart telling him that this was Edgiva
the Beautiful.</p>

<p>And then, just as she reached the spot where he
stood, for one moment a tiny hand appeared from beneath
the shrouding cloak, and a fair blossom dropped
at his feet. Then, ere he could speak or move, she had
passed on, and the church was empty.</p>

<p>"Now," said Wahrmund, speaking in low tones,
"we have seen strange things over which a man needs
ponder deeply. But methinks, comrade, all is done
now, and we had best look for our guide."</p>

<p>Then, ere Wulnoth could answer, a curtain was
drawn aside from an arching doorway, and the man
with whom they had come hither stood before them.</p>

<p>Now, this is how Wulnoth saw the burying of King
Edmund, and this is how he looked upon the image of
Him Whom he had called a nithing.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />

<small><em>Of How Wulnoth met with Edgiva again</em></small></h2>


<p>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_157.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">T</span>he man held the curtain
aside and invited them to
follow him.</p>

<p>"The Atheling bids you
come," he said. "And he
says to him called the Wanderer
that not yet has he
received that reward which
was promised to him."</p>

<p>"Come, Wanderer,"
laughed Wahrmund, "we may as well go through with
it now. By Thor! 't is strange that I, a Dane, should
be amongst these Saxons, but I feel inclined to see this
to the end. How sayest thou?"</p>

<p>Little need to ask Wulnoth such a question, for the
one desire of his heart was to see his Princess. Therefore
the two followed their guide, and were ushered into
an apartment where sat the two men whom they had
seen watching in the church.</p>

<p>And the younger, he who did not wear the crown,
came to welcome them and said&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>
<p>"Greeting, friends, and again thanks for the aid you
rendered me in securing honor for King Edmund's body."</p>

<p>Then he turned to the other, and went on&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ethelred, my royal and dear brother, these are the
two of whom I told you, and to their help are we indebted,
for otherwise it would have been a hard matter
to gain the body of the martyr."</p>

<p>"We thank you from our hearts, strangers," said
the one called Ethelred. And Wahrmund whispered to
his friend&mdash;</p>

<p>"By Thor! 'T is Ethelred, the King of the West
Saxons. He is son of the noble Ethelwulf the Bretwalda,
and the other must be his brother, the Atheling
Alfred."</p>

<p>Then did the King continue, looking hard at Wulnoth,
and he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"But what is this? We have no Dane here, brother!
This hair and those blue eyes are surely of the land of
our fathers!"</p>

<p>"That is so, royal brother," answered Alfred. "According
to all I have heard from the wise Wyborga, this
man is of the noble house of Cerdic, he from whom our
own house also traces its descent."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" the King cried. "It is good in one
way, and yet 't is strange to think of one of such royal
blood joining our foes."</p>

<p>"Strange is this man's story, my brother," Alfred
replied. "I have it as it was told to me," and he told
the King how Wulnoth came to Lethra with his father
and of all that had happened since.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>
<p>But the King shook his head as he listened, and
said that this did not explain how Wulnoth came to be
in Hungwar's army, seeing that it was Hungwar who
gave Lethra to fire and sword.</p>

<p>So Wulnoth spoke, and told how he had two tasks
to do&mdash;one to find Guthred the Prince, and the other to
find the mightiest and the strongest. And at that Alfred
the Atheling smiled gently.</p>

<p>"Now, brother," he said to the King, "this is a
task for priests, and perchance a fair teacher whom we
two wot of, and not for us. Thou seest how this man
chances to be with the Danes, and thou seest how 't is
but a step to discovering that for which he seeks. Let
this good warrior"&mdash;and he pointed to Wahrmund&mdash;"tarry
here with us and let the other go to his reward."</p>

<p>But the King looked grave and he said slowly&mdash;</p>

<p>"This man is a thrall, and Edgiva is a king's
daughter."</p>

<p>"This man is of our blood, and can noble blood
be debased because a thrall collar is placed upon the
neck? My word is pledged, brother, that this man shall
see the lady, and I pray you to allow it."</p>

<p>"Let it be so," said the King, and the Atheling
laughed. "Follow me, O Wanderer," he said to Wulnoth;
and as the Wanderer obeyed, he heard the deep
laugh of Wahrmund, and the words&mdash;</p>

<p>"Of a truth, O King, a wondrous thing is love.
You might offer yon man a golden crown now, and he
would not take it in exchange for a few moments with
a fair maiden."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>
<p>The Atheling led Wulnoth to another chamber
and bade him wait there, and presently there came a
light step, and Edgiva stood before him, holding out her
hands with a smile upon her lips.</p>

<p>And when Wulnoth saw her all his strength seemed
to go, and only a great love seized upon him so that he
dropped on his knees and took her hands and kissed
them, and cried, as if he had been a weak woman and
not a mighty man, and he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"O my Princess! my Princess! I have wandered
far to see you, and my heart has grown weary with
longing. Why have you hidden yourself from me all
this time, and I was your watcher who guarded you?
Oh! why have you done this thing, my Princess?"</p>

<p>And Edgiva bent over him, and in her beautiful
eyes there were tears also as she bade him rise and come
and sit beside her.</p>

<p>But Wulnoth shook his head and answered that
might not be, for she was the King's daughter and he
but a thrall.</p>

<p>"Now nay, Wulnoth," answered Edgiva. "Even
if what thou sayest is true, then it would be mine to
command and thine to obey. But this is not so. Thou
and I are friends as we were in the dear old days when
we were in Lethra&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I angered you, my Princess," he said. "I
angered you in the woods when I spoke of Thor." And
Edgiva looked grave.</p>

<p>"Nay, not angered, Wulnoth," she said gently. "I
was grieved, but I knew it would all come right in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>end. Now, Wulnoth, tell me, for we have but little time,
and perchance we may not meet again yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not meet!" he cried. "Oh, my Princess, thou
wilt not send me away again!"</p>

<p>"Wulnoth, thou hast thy work, and I have mine,"
she answered, "and we must fulfil our tasks. Now
listen then to my words. Thou hast longed to find me
again?"</p>

<p>"I have longed to find you, O Princess," he answered.
"For I am thy watcher."</p>

<p>"And only because thou art my watcher?" she
answered softly, and he made no reply.</p>

<p>"Canst thou not answer my question, Wulnoth?"
she asked again. "Hast thou longed to find me only
because thou art my watcher?"</p>

<p>And then he looked up, and his strong face was full
of light, yet his voice was full of pain, and he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, my Princess, that is the first cruel thing that
thou hast done to me, for why wilt thou have me tell my
heart's story to thee, seeing that thou art so far away
from me? Yet if thou wilt have it so, it shall be. I
have longed for thee, Edgiva, because I love thee&mdash;because
not a maiden in the world has moved my heart
as thou hast done; because in my dreams thou hast
smiled upon me. I love thee, Princess&mdash;I who am thrall
and thy watcher&mdash;and now that the matter is told,
send for thy servants and have me cast out."</p>

<p>And then, while he knelt there with bowed head,
one little arm crept round his neck, and a dear, gentle
voice spoke in his ear saying&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>
<p>"Oh, thou great, strong, hero-hearted, foolish Wulnoth!
Had it been my wish to cast thee forth, dost thou
think I had let thee see me, or speak such words as thou
hast now done? Wulnoth, they are heart music to me.
Thou foolish Wulnoth, to be jealous as thou wast in
the forest! Thou loyal Wulnoth, to resist the temptation
wherewith Wyborga tempted thee to tarry there
with me! Kiss me, Wulnoth, my great bear of a lover,
for truly thou art as big and as strong and as shaggy
as a bear, but thou art my love, and no other love have
I had, save my Lord Whom I serve."</p>

<p>Then all music came into Wulnoth's soul, for he
knew that Edgiva loved him, and he felt that nothing
else mattered in this world now, and he asked her how
it was since she loved him that she had fled away from
him in the past.</p>

<p>"Canst thou not see, Wulnoth?" Edgiva answered.
"It was because I loved thee. But I had learnt to love
the Lord, and thou didst know nothing of Him, and
hadst thou made me thy wife then, I should have followed
thee and have forgotten my Lord."</p>

<p>"Yet I am not a Christian now, Edgiva," he said.
"And not even to win thee would I call myself one
unless I could do so honestly."</p>

<p>"I know that, Wulnoth," she answered. "But the
time will come when thou dost understand. Tell me,
dost thou still think the Lord a nithing, and His worship
fit only for weaklings?" And at that Wulnoth shook
his head.</p>

<p>"Princess," he said, "I am like a man who walks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>in a wood having lost his way, or like those who are
caught by the sea fog off a rocky shore. I know not
what to think. For of a truth it seems strange for
strong men to suffer wrong when they have swords by
their sides; and yet I have seen the King die, and&mdash;it
was more than I could fathom; and I have looked
at the image in the church yonder&mdash;the image on the
cross, and it seemed to speak to me. I know not what
to think."</p>

<p>"And hast thou found the mightiest leader yet,
Wulnoth?" she asked. And he shook his head again.</p>

<p>"Nay, Princess. I sought old Regner Lodbrok, for
he was called the mightiest, but he died here in this
land, and thus it is that I come to be with those who are
doubly mine enemies, seeing that they are Danes, and
those who ruined Lethra's kingdom&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So Wyborga told me that you would," Edgiva
said. "She is wise and can prophesy, and it was she
who foresaw your coming, and that the Prince should
meet you in the forest. It was she who said that you
should be in the church to-night, and it was she who
said that I might see you. And, Wulnoth, if you have
longed to see me, I also have longed for you, and comforted
my heart that we should meet again."</p>

<p>"But oh, my love," he answered, "thou art beautiful
and a king's daughter, and I am&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of the Royal House of Cerdic&mdash;of the same
stock as the King of the West Saxons. Thou must do
mighty deeds for me, Wulnoth, and earn me a name,
and then I shall be proud of thee."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>
<p>"But how can I, Princess? I am of the Danes now.
I must leave them and come to my own people&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay, Wulnoth. Wyborga told me of this thing.
She said that thou shouldst not do that, for the parting
with Hungwar and his brother would come without
seeking it in that fashion. Go back to the camp and
wait; and now know, Wulnoth, that I do love thee,
and that I shall love none other. Yet we cannot be
more than friends until thou hast finished thy quest&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And found Guthred?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Nay, but found the mightiest, and the bravest, and
the grandest amongst men," she answered.</p>

<p>"Dost thou know, Edgiva, that it hath been told to
me that Hungwar still remembers thee, and that he
would fain find thee?" Wulnoth asked. And she smiled.</p>

<p>"Ay, I know that, Wulnoth," she answered; "and
indeed I should be afraid, but that I know thou wilt
be near me now, and while thou art nigh, I fear not
Hungwar."</p>

<p>Then they were silent, standing side by side, hand
in hand, and love in their hearts. And it was peace
time in their souls, when all the world seemed fair, and
when all nature was singing, just as it had done in
the past when, as children, they wandered with Guthred
in the flower-laden fields, or the shady groves
of Lethra. And Edgiva lifted her face to him and
smiled, and her eyes spoke words that her lips uttered
not; and Wulnoth bent and kissed her, and in that kiss
their souls seemed joined, so that none might come
between them forever.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>
<p>Then did Wyborga come and bid Wulnoth join
his friend again, for the way was long, and the hours
were fleeing; and Wulnoth came and Edgiva with him;
and when Wahrmund saw the Princess, he stared open-mouthed,
and he cried&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thora, beloved of Regner, the son of Sigurd, was
called the most beautiful of women; but here is one
more beautiful. Not Freya herself is more fair than
thou art, Princess."</p>

<p>"Thou art a flatterer, Dane," laughed Alfred the
Atheling; but Wahrmund answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"Not so, Prince. I speak what I think; and I
counsel thee, if counsel I may, to keep this pearl from
the sight of Hungwar and his friends; for surely they
would burn this land into gray ash to secure such a
treasure."</p>

<p>"Methinks our royal sister looks far more gay than
she has done for many a day, brother," said the King
with a smile. And Edgiva answered steadily, and with
never a blush&mdash;</p>

<p>"That is true, royal Ethelred, for I have found again
my hero." And at that the King laughed again.</p>

<p>Then did the Atheling turn to Wulnoth and ask him
of his search after the mightiest, and where he would now
look, seeing that Regner Lodbrok was dead; and Wulnoth
answered that he knew not where to look now, unless he
went afar to Rome and sought the Emperor.</p>

<p>"Now, Wulnoth," the Atheling said, "let me be
thy redesman in this. Thou didst think that Regner
Lodbrok was the mightiest warrior?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>
<p>"Then, by my beard, he was not far out," cried
Wahrmund. And the Prince smiled.</p>

<p>"So! Yet this Regner is dead, and there is no king
but must die in the end."</p>

<p>"That is true, Prince," Wulnoth said; and Wahrmund
nodded.</p>

<p>"Then death is mightier than the mightiest," said
Alfred. And Wulnoth looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"Does that mean we should follow death, Prince?"
he said. "By my word, we soldiers do that all our
lives, methinks."</p>

<p>"Nay, Wulnoth. 'T is true we follow death, for 't is
our call; but there is one mightier than death even."</p>

<p>"Mightier than death!" cried Wahrmund. "That
is hard saying, Prince; for what, or who, is mightier
than death?" And to that the Prince answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"Life is mightier than death. Do not thy own
sagas tell thee that the heroes live again in Walhalla,
and that they perish no more?"</p>

<p>"Ay," answered Wahrmund. "Though whether
it be true or not, I cannot say."</p>

<p>"Wulnoth," the Prince went on, "thou didst see
the image of Him Who hung on the cross? He Whom
thou didst once call nithing, I hear."</p>

<p>"I have seen, Prince," Wulnoth answered.</p>

<p>"Then know He is the Lord of Life; and to conquer
death He died, and He rose again. Death and He
went holmgang, and He conquered. He is the mightiest,
and by Him shall we drive out our foes and conquer
Thor and his followers."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>
<p>"Do not be too sure of that, Prince," growled
Wahrmund, not liking to hear his people spoken of so;
but the Prince went on&mdash;</p>

<p>"Nay, I mean not to offend you, brave soldier. I
only speak what I feel. Have you not told me that you
wondered to see how King Edmund braved the worst
torture and pain?"</p>

<p>"That is so," the Dane answered. And once more
the Prince went on&mdash;</p>

<p>"And how did he do this? He was strengthened by
the Lord; and He Who had suffered succored him in his
suffering. Now, it is to Him that you must turn. But
now," he added, "the morning draws near, and you two
must be back at the camp ere day breaks; so let us bid
each other farewell, and perchance we may meet again."</p>

<p>So they clasped each other's hands, the Saxons and
the Dane; and Edgiva smiled on Wulnoth, and whispered
her love-parting; and then he and Wahrmund
set out, guided by him who had brought them, until
they reached the forest.</p>

<p>And when at last they were alone, the Dane stopped
and stroked his beard, and he said slowly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Comrade, we two have seen strange things to-night,
and heard strange things, too. But beware how
you speak of them to me where other ears may listen;
for there are three things which Hungwar would be
glad to have."</p>

<p>"What are they, Wahrmund?" asked Wulnoth
carelessly; for he was so happy that he cared little for
Hungwar and his wants.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>
<p>"Wanderer, the son of Regner would like the gold
from yon Christian altar; and he would like to have
that Atheling in his power; and he would like to have
the Lady Edgiva also."</p>

<p>"He shall have my axe ere he has one of the three,"
said Wulnoth; and the Dane laughed grimly.</p>

<p>"Bold words! But the son of Regner is no nithing
nor weakling; and he has some warriors around him,
Wanderer. Thou mayst be strong, but thou art not
strong enough for that; therefore, I warn thee be discreet
and hold thy tongue."</p>

<p>Now, this is how Wulnoth found his Princess, and
how the love tale was spoken, and this is how Alfred
the Atheling told Wulnoth of the Mightiest and the
Bravest of Lords.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />

<small><em>How Wahrmund the Dane gave his
Life for Wulnoth</em></small></h2>


<p>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_169.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">N</span>ow, though Hungwar the
Dane had evil thoughts
respecting Wulnoth and
Wahrmund, he held his
peace and kept his own counsel
at the first; and in the
morning, when the two were
in the hall, he greeted them
with a dark smile, and he
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Greeting, Wulnoth, and greeting, Wahrmund.
You are cunning warriors; for while we have been
feasting and drinking and listening to the songs of the
scalds, we have missed your faces; and methinks, surely,
that ye have been spying out the land, and seeing where
the foe hide."</p>

<p>"We have been wandering, O chief," answered
Wulnoth. And Hungwar laughed loudly.</p>

<p>"What should the Wanderer do but wander?" he
cried. "Thou art not content with doing the deeds of
ordinary men, thou rider on sea monsters and thou
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>doer of great deeds. But take care, lest one day thou do
a deed too many, and a little thing, like a spear or a
sword, make thy strength become weakness."</p>

<p>"Death comes to all in time, O chief," Wulnoth
answered; and again Hungwar laughed.</p>

<p>"True, O Wanderer; yet sometimes he comes to
some sooner than to others&mdash;and there are other ways
of dying than by the man's tools."</p>

<p>"Look you, Wanderer," growled Wahrmund, when
the two were alone, "we are in an evil case, we two;
for Hungwar suspects, and when he is suspicious he
puts an end to doubts with the sword or the axe. We
are surely in an evil case, Wanderer."</p>

<p>And to that Wulnoth answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"It may be as thou sayest, Wahrmund, for this
son of Regner is to my mind more of a nithing than a
hero."</p>

<p>"That is but partly true," answered Wahrmund,
jealous for the honor of his chief. "True, he is cruel
and merciless, but when it comes to playing the man's
game, where the blows are the hardest and the sword
sings the loudest, there, be sure, will Hungwar be found.
Still, we are in an evil case, and I see not how to advise
thee. My rede is that thou flee at once, lest evil befall
thee."</p>

<p>"I flee not," answered Wulnoth; "I am no nithing.
Edgiva told me that Wyborga, who is a wise
woman and a prophetess, declared that I should abide
here until I received a sign, and I see no sign yet."</p>

<p>"To my mind," answered Wahrmund, "Hungwar's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>words are sign enough for any man, and you will be wise
to take them."</p>

<p>"Do you flee with me?" Wulnoth asked. And the
Dane swore a mighty oath by Thor that he would not.</p>

<p>"I have followed Regner Lodbrok since I was a
boy," he said, "and I will follow his son, unless he attempts
my life or does a shame deed to me. If that
day comes, then I will fight my last fight with back to
wall, and some shall go with me to Walhalla."</p>

<p>"Then if thou dost not flee, I do not flee," answered
Wulnoth, and there the matter ended for the time.</p>

<p>Yet Wulnoth had much to think of; and the more
he thought, the more he felt that the gods of the North
were false gods, and that the God of Christians was
the true God; and that it was by bearing that conquest
came. And yet that puzzled him, for he felt that a
warrior should war; and he knew that if Hungwar
tried to do him harm, then he should fight and make
his big sword sing a good song ere he was vanquished.</p>

<p>And more than once did his friend urge him to
escape, saying that he was sure that Hungwar thought
evil against him, and would seek soon to do him harm;
but to all the pleading, Wulnoth answered that while
Wahrmund stayed, he would stay also.</p>

<p>Yet Hungwar did plot evil against Wulnoth, and
in a cunning way. He knew that the Wanderer looked
with anger upon the killing of King Edmund, and he
thought to have that done which should make Wulnoth
speak rashly, and so bring him into his power; and thus
it is that he did it. One of the bands of Danes which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>had roamed the country brought tidings of a village
hidden away amidst the marshes, where old people and
women and little children dwelt; and the chiefs, in cruel
sport, said that they would go against this village themselves,
and teach the churls the way to the storm-land;
and Hungwar called upon Wulnoth and Wahrmund
to be of his party.</p>

<p>Now, Wulnoth was troubled at this, and yet he
knew not how to escape the going; and he comforted
himself by thinking that when the sword sang and the
red flames danced, then he might be able to save some
of the poor victims and aid them to escape.</p>

<p>So the Danes went out on their cruel errand, and
the village was surrounded, and the houses given to the
fire; and the people were collected and brought into
the midst of the Danes.</p>

<p>And then Hungwar and Hubba, raging like wolves,
ordered the men to be tortured, and the women to be
burnt, and the children and the maidens to be put to
death by the warriors; and Wulnoth felt a great anger
coming into his heart, and his blood began to tingle as it
beat through his veins, and the spirit of the berserker
came upon him; and at last he could stand idle no
longer; and just then Hungwar called to him and
mocked him, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah, Wanderer, thou art a sluggard. Thy sword
has had no drink, and thy axe is dry. To work, Wanderer,
to work, and join our sport."</p>

<p>"Patience, Hungwar," answered Wulnoth grimly.
"Sword and axe shall have their fill. This murdering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>of prisoners is a nithing's game, fit only for such dogs
as thou and thy companions. This is better sport for
me." And with that he struck a mighty blow with his
fist at one viking who had speared a little child; and,
though he hit but with his fist, the man dropped dead.</p>

<p>"Thou dog!" roared Hungwar. "Dost thou dare
to speak so to me? I will have thy tongue cut out for
this insolence."</p>

<p>"Come and do it thyself, Dane," answered Wulnoth.
"Or shall I come to thee?" and he strode towards
the chief.</p>

<p>But men ran between them, and a score of weapons
were raised against him, and many voices cried out
that he should die.</p>

<p>"Now this is a man's game," he laughed. "Pity
't is that Hungwar will not play in it"; and he swung
his axe high, and made it play like a circle of fire around
his head, and wherever that axe fell there fell a viking
of Denmark.</p>

<p>"Do not slay him. Take him alive," cried Hungwar,
keeping out of reach of danger himself. "And take
Wahrmund also, for he is a traitor, and the two know
of the treasure of the Saxons and where the West Saxon
King is. Take them alive, and the torture shall make
them cry for mercy."</p>

<p>"Now, by Thor!" growled Wahrmund, when he
heard that, "for forty years have I warred for Denmark
and followed thy house, O Hungwar; and I looked
to go to the storm-land doing so. But thou takest me
not prisoner, and thou puttest me not to torture. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>now I tell thee, as the Wanderer has told thee, that thou
art a nithing and a coward, and more fit to lead ravening
wolves than to direct heroes. Come thou hither
and take me, thou coward."</p>

<p>But Hungwar only answered&mdash;"Take them alive.
Do them no hurt," and he foamed at the mouth like an
angry bear, and shook his fists in the air.</p>

<p>"Now, Wanderer, there is a game to play and a
song to be sung," cried Wahrmund, as he reached
Wulnoth's side. "Stand thou beside me and let us see
what we may do in this case."</p>

<p>So side by side they stood, their faces to the foe;
and the Danes circled round them, seeking to find a
place for spear thrust or sword stroke. But ever the
shields received the blow, and ever the axes answered
the stroke, and men fell shorn and gashed, and still the
two champions stood unscathed.</p>

<p>And then, when the foe gathered for a greater rush,
Wulnoth's strength came, like unto madness; and he
rushed forward and caught a warrior in each hand
and whirled them round as if they were flails, so that
the vikings drew back in horror and fear, for they had
never seen men strong like as Wulnoth was.</p>

<p>Then loud the Wanderer laughed, and he cried to
his friend&mdash;</p>

<p>"'T is a good fight, Wahrmund, comrade, and one
worth the fighting. We have slain many. Now shall
we make an end and rush upon them, and take this
Hungwar with us to the storm-land?"</p>

<p>But Wahrmund answered&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>
<p>"Hast thou forgotten Edgiva the Beautiful, Wanderer?
She will weep for thee, and, moreover, thou
mayst yet be needed to watch over her. I see no sense
in staying here to be slaughtered. Let us retreat side
by side, and since these holdas cast us out, seek the
Atheling and lend him our aid."</p>

<p>"Now surely thy words are good words, comrade,"
Wulnoth answered. "For if this is not the sign for
which I waited, then I know not what may be. So
shield in front and axe ready, let us step backwards,
comrade, and then, if we can reach the forest, all may
be well."</p>

<p>Then the two heroes began to step backwards, still
facing their enemy, and around them swarmed the host
of the foe, pressing hard and sore, until at last Wahrmund
cried to Wulnoth that they should run.</p>

<p>"No scald can say we are nithing or weak," he
said, "for we have fought a good fight. But fain would
I see thee live, Wulnoth, since that is thy real name,
for I see thou hast a word to say to Hungwar yet. As
for me, I know this is my last fight, for I am sore
wounded&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Say not 't is thy last fight, comrade," cried Wulnoth.
"If thou dost tarry, then I tarry with thee."</p>

<p>"Think thou of Edgiva," said Wahrmund. And
Wulnoth answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"I do think of her. I think I should be shamed to
look her in the face and say I deserted a wounded
comrade."</p>

<p>"I wish thee to live that thou mayst avenge me,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>Wahrmund said. But all that Wulnoth would answer
was&mdash;</p>

<p>"I will avenge thee, ere I die by thy side."</p>

<p>Now, Wahrmund perceived that Wulnoth had the
berserker spirit upon him, and that he was as one mad,
who would listen to no reason; and yet he was minded
to save him for the sake of Edgiva the Beautiful, so he
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now come, then, and run, for nigh this spot is a
deep ravine, the which is crossed by a single plank, and
if we gain that, we can there hold our own and make a
good fight."</p>

<p>"So be it," replied Wulnoth, and together they ran,
though Wahrmund was sore in pain and wounded
deeply, and soon the bridge was in sight.</p>

<p>It was but a log laid across a cleft in the earth, and
the cleft was so wide that no man might hope to leap
it, and so deep that it was death to try to descend its
sides, and the trunk was but laid on the earth.</p>

<p>"Cross thou first, Wulnoth," gasped Wahrmund.
"Cross, and hold the other end steady, for it rests on
a stone, and I fear I should fall if I tried to walk over
first."</p>

<p>The Danes were now hard upon them, and to the
soldiers were joined many chiefs of fame, all full of fury
at the deed that had been done.</p>

<p>Wulnoth, thinking nothing of what was in his
friend's heart, rushed across and turned to hold the
log steady, but Wahrmund stopped at his end and he
seized the log with both hands and hurled it down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>into the chasm so that none might pass to Wulnoth,
and he could not return to them.</p>

<p>"What hast thou done, Wahrmund, my friend?"
cried Wulnoth in despair, but Wahrmund smiled and
waved his hand.</p>

<p>"Flee thou, comrade," he answered. "I did this
on purpose, for I knew thou wouldst not leave me, and
I am minded that thou shalt escape. Wulnoth, the
death shadow is upon me, and when that is so men see
far ahead. I tell thee, thou son of Cerdic, that thou hast
a big work to do, and thou must live; while as for me,
my work is done, and I go to the storm-land."</p>

<p>"Oh, skoal to thee, thou hero!" cried Wulnoth.
"Would that I might cross again and stand by thy
side!"</p>

<p>"That thou canst not do," answered Wahrmund;
and then he turned, standing with his back to the chasm
and his shield advanced, and thus he met the rush of
the foe, and made his axe sing a good song and bite
deeply ere he fell himself.</p>

<p>And Wulnoth stood on the farther bank and
watched the fight, and he cried aloud in his grief and
called upon the Danes to fight fairly.</p>

<p>"Oh, nithings!" he cried. "Oh, slayers of little
children and weaklings, is there not a man amongst you
now? Does no hero soul dwell in Denmark? Not so
would Regner Lodbrok have dealt with a brave man.
Oh, cowards and nithings that you are, would I were
with my friend, to stand by his side!"</p>

<p>But little did the Danes heed his cries. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>pressed upon brave Wahrmund, seeking to take him
alive. He was bleeding from a score of wounds, and his
strength was all gone.</p>

<p>He tried to cast himself into the chasm, but they
laid hands upon him, seeking to drag him away; and he
turned his face towards Wulnoth, and cried to him&mdash;</p>

<p>"A boon, comrade&mdash;a boon for friendship's sake!
Thou hast thy spear. A cast, comrade&mdash;a good, true
cast, right between the shoulders. Better death from
a comrade's spear than torture by Hungwar."</p>

<p>Then, as he made an end of speaking, he turned
back to the foe, gripping them and holding them at
arm's length, planting his feet firmly and standing with
his back towards Wulnoth.</p>

<p>And Wulnoth understood, and he raised his spear.</p>

<p>"Skoal to thee, hero amongst men," he cried. "Art
ready?" and Wahrmund panted&mdash;</p>

<p>"Skoal and farewell. I am ready, comrade."</p>

<p>Then, straight and true flew Wulnoth's spear, and
it smote Wahrmund right between the shoulders and
stood out a hand's breadth in front, and the old viking
fell, dragging two of his foes with him down into the
chasm into which he had cast the log.</p>

<p>Then did Wulnoth stand on the other bank, and
some cast their spears, but he caught them on his shield,
and he cried to Hungwar and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Listen to me, thou nithing, thou wolf that eats
up little children, thou fearer of grown men. There is
a mark on thy cheek, and I put it there&mdash;I, when only
a boy; and had it not been for this man whom thou
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>hast watched die, I had surely made an end of thee on
that day with my broken weapon. I am Wulnoth, son
of Cerdic, thou Danish nithing, and of a surety one day
thou and I shall meet again, and then shall a deed be
done and a word said between us twain, Hungwar, son
of Regner; and until then, farewell." And with that
Wulnoth turned and plunged into the woodlands, and
the Danes returned to their camp.</p>

<p>Now, this is how Wahrmund the Dane gave his life
to save his friend, and this is how Wulnoth the Wanderer
made himself known to Hungwar, the son of
Regner Lodbrok.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>



<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />

<small><em>How Wulnoth came to Alfred</em></small></h2>


<p>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_180.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">N</span>ow, on through the forest
pressed Wulnoth, and his
heart was heavy within him
because of the dying of
Wahrmund his friend, and
he thought to himself that
now he would seek the West
Saxons and fight for them,
and that this would be right,
seeing that he also was Saxon.</p>

<p>"This Hungwar has cast me out," he mused, "so
none may say that I am false in the doing of this; for
a man must side with some, and since it cannot be with
Hungwar it must be against him."</p>

<p>And then he thought that all this must be fixed
from of old, and he laughed.</p>

<p>"No cause have I to love these black Danes," he
said, "and no cause to love the sons of Regner Lodbrok.
I will seek this Alfred, and perchance I may find
him mightier than Hungwar, and so my rede will be
read."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>
<p>But then he thought that Alfred himself had said
that the White Christ was the mightiest of all, and at
that he frowned. Not yet did Wulnoth feel any love
for that Lord, and he was too honest to pretend to a
faith which he did not possess&mdash;not even for Edgiva
would he do that.</p>

<p>"A man's word is as a man's honor," he said, "and
a man's honor should be as a man's life. I will not tell
my Princess that I love her Lord until I can feel that
He is my Lord indeed."</p>

<p>"Then there you are foolish, Wanderer," said a
mocking voice in his ear, and he turned, his hand on his
sword, to see beside him that strange being so like himself,
who had taken his name and fought with him in
the past days.</p>

<p>"You here!" he cried sternly. "Have I not bidden
thee leave me and trouble me no more?"</p>

<p>"As well bid your shadow leave you, Wanderer,"
was the answer he received. "Said I not to you that I
would be with you&mdash;that I would be your servant?
Now you have been foolish, and much trouble has come
from it. Of old you might have possessed this Princess,
and now you may do so&mdash;for what matters it what
faith you profess, seeing that they all are equally vain.
Go to this Alfred, declare you are a Christian, marry
the Princess, and all will be well."</p>

<p>"Thou tempter, so like myself that thou seemest
my very double!" cried Wulnoth. "I will not listen
to such base words."</p>

<p>"Base words! Foolish thought! Does not the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>wise man get that which he covets in the easiest way?
Still, if thou art so tender in thy conscience, I will tell
thee another way&mdash;a way like unto that which heroes
have practised from of old."</p>

<p>"What is thy way?" asked Wulnoth suspiciously,
for he liked not this man's counsel. And the other answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"This is my way, Wanderer, and 't is counsel fit
for hero to hear. As thou goest on thy road thou shalt
find a band of masterless men, good fighters every one.
Now make thyself leader of these, and be no man to
Saxon or Dane. There is land to be won by strong
hand and keen sword, and thou canst carry off thy
Princess, as many a jarl has carried off his wife."</p>

<p>"Now, out on thee for a base churl!" cried Wulnoth
angrily. "What! I carry off my Princess? By
Thor, we fight again for that!"</p>

<p>"And, by Thor, I will win thee," laughed the other.
"For here we have no light to throw crosses on the
ground. 'T is my time, and my hour, and I will conquer,
and thou shalt carry off the Princess as I have
said."</p>

<p>So there again these two fought, as they had fought
so often before, and now the stranger seemed much the
stronger, strong though Wulnoth was, and he laughed
aloud, and cried&mdash;</p>

<p>"O Wanderer, thou hast denied the White Christ
and called Him nithing, and His sign shall not help
thee now."</p>

<p>"Who art thou who hast my name and my form?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>gasped Wulnoth hoarsely. "Who art thou who thus
seekest to war with me though I have beaten thee
before? This time I will kill thee."</p>

<p>"Nay, that thou wilt not. Because thou hast beaten
me, therefore fight I still. When I have conquered, then
we will be at peace. As for who I am, I have told thee
that I am Wulnoth, son of Cerdic, and if thou art also
Wulnoth, then we are one, and Wulnoth is Wulnoth's
foe. So read my riddle if thou canst&mdash;and now I have
conquered."</p>

<p>And with that the stranger threw Wulnoth and
rested on him, one knee on his chest and one hand at
his throat, and his dagger gleamed high in the air.</p>

<p>But Wulnoth stretched out his hand and gripped
his sword, which he had let slip. And lo, he picked
it up blindly and held it aloft, and it was hilt up, and the
hilt was crossed after the manner of a champion's
weapon.</p>

<p>"'T is the White Christ's sign!" he gasped, as his
eyes fell upon it; and as he spoke his strength seemed to
return, and he flung the stranger from him and rose
joyfully, and the stranger fled away into the darkness,
crying as he fled, "Lost! Lost! Lost!"</p>

<p>"This sign is a wonderful sign," thought Wulnoth.
"I must think more of it, for how can the White Christ
be so weak if His sign is so powerful? I must truly
think more of this."</p>

<p>Now, for a night and a day did Wulnoth wander,
seeking to find the way to the lake and the island
whereon was the church where the dead King was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>buried, but he searched in vain and his heart grew
weary.</p>

<p>It was a dreadful country in which he found himself&mdash;flat
and broken with many a stream, and marshy,
so that the feet sank in ooze, and at night white mists
rose, like ghosts from the fens, and encircled all things,
and chilled him to the bone; yet still he pushed on,
seeing only ruins and the handwork of the Danes.
And so he journeyed until he came to better land, where
he found people.</p>

<p>But none could tell him of the island with its
church, or if they could, they would not, for all looked
upon him with suspicion, and many cursed him for a
Northland haco and bade him begone, lest he find his
death-sleep through tarrying.</p>

<p>Sometimes Wulnoth felt angry at this, but he
thought of the hard things these people had suffered,
and that it was but natural they should view him with
distrust, and so he went his way.</p>

<p>Yet not all spoke so; some were kindly and gave
him shelter, but none could tell him of the King of the
West Saxons beyond saying that they had heard how
he and the Atheling had travelled swiftly back into
their kingdom of Wessex. So on Wulnoth pushed, asking
his way, for since he could not find Edgiva, the
next best thing to do was to find Alfred.</p>

<p>And in a dense wood he came, as the stranger had
said he would, upon a band of masterless men seated
around a fire; and they started up and asked him who he
was, and demanded his money, at which Wulnoth laughed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>
<p>"Why, friends," he said, "if you never get richer
than I shall make you, you will stay poor, for of money
have I none, who am but a wanderer&mdash;a nameless and
a landless man."</p>

<p>"Then thou art as a brother to us," the others
said; "and come thou and join us, for thou dost look
a likely man, Wanderer."</p>

<p>Then the Wanderer sat down by their fire, and
he looked upon their bold, rugged faces and saw that
they were men hardened in war, and fighters each and
all, and he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Fain would I join you if you would join me."
And at that they asked him what his words might mean.</p>

<p>"This do I mean," he answered calmly. "There
are strangers in this land playing your game, and playing
it better than ye can. The Black Strangers give
the land to fire and sword so that the flames run from
east to west, until they slack their thirst in the farther
waters; and the heart of this people is weak as water.
Men are wanted&mdash;fighters&mdash;and, methinks, to stay
here and harry those who are harried, and rob those
who are robbed, is but a nithing's game, and with no
glory in it. I go to find the King of Saxons, and offer
my sword to him. Come ye with me and be men, and
strike for your land instead of warring against it."</p>

<p>And then did he tell them of the cruel works of
the Danes, until they started up and said that it was
a good word which he had spoken, and that they
would go forth with him and offer their swords to the
King.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>
<p>"But where is the King?" one asked; and another
answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"He tarries nigh Welandes Smithan, with Osburga,
his lady mother; and there, close to the White Horse,
shall we find him."<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>"Then let us go forward at once," cried the rest.
"Only we go not nigh Welandes Smithan by night,
for 't is an evil spot and haunted by night-hags and
ghosts. Long should I walk, if I had to wait for
riding until the elf smith shod my horse."</p>

<p>"Who, then, is this Wieland, that ye fear?" asked
Wulnoth, curiously; and the robbers answered that
none knew, that none ever saw him, but that if any man
went to his forge, which was only a number of mighty
stones set on the bleak moor, and placed a piece of
money on one stone and tied his horse to another, and
then went his way, that when he returned, if he had
been faithful and had not sought to pry, there the
horse would be shod, and the money gone, though
never a man could there be seen in the place.</p>

<p>"The good Lord shield us from all such wizardry,"
cried one robber; and Wulnoth stared at that. "The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>good Lord!" Then these robbers held that the White
Christ was greater than the wizards and night-hags and
the ghost smith of Wieland's forge!</p>

<p>"Where tarries the King himself?" he asked.
"Surely 't is he whom we should seek, and not the
Atheling."</p>

<p>"The King is gone to his house at Winchester, I
hear, there to take counsel with his thanes and ealdormen
in the Witenagemot. For, mark you this, Wanderer&mdash;if
these black strangers come into our good
Wessex, they will find us fiercer fighters than were
those of East Anglia."</p>

<p>"Ay, that is your fault," said Wulnoth. And the
robbers looked surprised.</p>

<p>"Our fault? What&mdash;that we fight well?"</p>

<p>"Now, nay," answered Wulnoth, with a smile, "for
that is no fault, but that ye are so divided amongst
yourselves into East and West Saxons, and men of
Mercia and Northumbria. These Danes come as one,
and they come like clouds of flies, and they will eat
up one place at a time, when, if ye were all bound together,
they could not stand before you. There will be
hard work before us before we drive them out, and
there will be hero deeds and death-songs for many a
one."</p>

<p>"And what could man want better?" laughed the
robbers. "Come, let us march, and&mdash;the best song for
the best man."</p>

<p>So Wulnoth, instead of being alone, now found
himself with fifty good fighters, and though he was not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>their captain, they were going at his advice, and that
was something.</p>

<p>For six days they marched on, mostly by night,
and through the wild lands; for, as the robbers said,
they were nameless men, and if any ealdorman or
thane heard of their presence near his hold, he might
sally out and make an end of them for being robbers,
and hang their leaders on the nearest trees, without
waiting to hear of what they were thinking of doing.</p>

<p>"Not but what they make us what we are, ofttimes,"
growled the captain. "For, look you, I am a
Sethcundman. For four generations, father and son,
we held our five hydes, and each hyde of a hundred
good acres; and if that does not make us Sethcundmen
and gentle, then what does? Yet down on our land
came Seward, son of Beorn,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> son of the bear, and he
seized our holdings and drove us out. What wonder
that we reply by robbing, since we have been robbed?
Look at Sigwad yonder&mdash;he could not pay the tax
when the King's house-carls called for it; and lo, they
sold all he had, and his wife died on the wayside. Thus
do we, who are of the people, grow discontented, and
meet violence with violence, giving blow for blow."</p>

<p>"But while the rich oppress you, you oppress the
poor, your brethren," answered Wulnoth; "and that
is but a poor thing in my eyes. But perchance now, if
we do our part in this business, those who are great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>will see that those who are beneath them are men.
Why, yonder black strangers would not hold together
a month if the chiefs looked down on the warriors.
But hark, methought I heard the sound of a horn in
the woods yonder. What may that be?"</p>

<p>"Some following the hunt, most like," came the
answer; "yet we will wait awhile and see what goes
forward."</p>

<p>So amongst the bushes they sank down; for there
was nothing to be gained in going forward, if that
meant going to struggle with their own countrymen;
and Wulnoth, accompanied by the captain, went on to
spy out the peril ahead.</p>

<p>On through the glades they went; and presently
they came to one wherein they saw a great boar, a
waster of the woods, standing savagely at bay, the
while two gallant hounds stood before it.</p>

<p>Brave dogs were they; but one was sorely ripped
by those gleaming tusks, and the other stood over him,
barking defiance.</p>

<p>"An unequal fight!" cried Wulnoth, lifting his
spear. But the robber caught his hand.</p>

<p>"Thou fool!" he said. "Most like some great
thane hunts the boar, and do you think he would thank
you for slaying it? Wait. See, here he comes."</p>

<p>A young man sprang into the glade, cheering on
his dog, but the boar broke upon the hound and tore
it, and then came towards the man, who awaited it,
spear in hand.</p>

<p>"Why!" cried the robber&mdash;"see, 't is the Atheling,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>and his sickness is upon him. See, see&mdash;the boar has
him now, for sure."</p>

<p>And Wulnoth, looking, saw the Prince place his
hand to his head and stagger, as one who has been
too long at the ale horn; the point of his spear dropped,
he made an effort to recover himself, and then he fell
to the earth, right in the track of the waster!</p>

<p>"He is dead now!" cried the robber. "That brute
will have the hope of the West Saxons, and nothing
can hinder it."</p>

<p>"That we will see!" answered Wulnoth, and he
made a cast, a mighty cast, such as, of old, Osth the
giant had taught him to throw; and his spear sang, and
smote that foaming, ravening monster full in the flank,
and passed on and split his grim, savage heart in twain;
and the waster fell, its great snout just reaching to the
senseless man's breast.</p>

<p>"By Thor, a good cast," cried Wulnoth, drawing
his knife and leaping forward. "Follow me, friend,
and let us make sure the brute is dead."</p>

<p>They ran to the spot, and they saw at a glance there
was nothing to fear from the boar; so they knelt over
the Atheling and raised his head and loosened his tunic,
when a band rushed forward with fierce shouts and
seized them, crying out that they were robbers who had
slain the Atheling.</p>

<p>"Little need to have slain your Prince," laughed
Wulnoth, pointing to the boar. "Yon beast would have
done it soon enough had it not been for my spear."
And at that the men stopped and looked, and said that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>it was not the spear of the Prince that stood out from
the boar's side.</p>

<p>"See! he opens his eyes. Now shall we know the
truth," one man cried. And the word was true&mdash;the
Atheling sighed and raised himself, looking round in
bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Good friends! How comes it that I am unharmed?"
he said. "I fell as the boar rushed at me.
Who saved me, and who are these men whom ye hold?"</p>

<p>"Greeting, Prince," said Wulnoth. "It was I who
saved you; and these hold us because they think we are
robbers who have done you harm."</p>

<p>"What&mdash;Wanderer!" cried the Prince, with a
kindly smile. "No robber thou; and so thou hast saved
me. But," he added, and his face grew stern, "thy
companion is a nameless man, for I know his face."</p>

<p>"True, O Prince, and a nameless man wants a
name, methinks. I met this companion and his merry
lads, and together we have journeyed to see thee; for
there are fifty strong arms waiting to draw sword, and
they had better be for thee than against thee, methinks."</p>

<p>"Is this so?" asked the Prince, turning to the
robber. "Do you truly desire to fight as honest men
should, against our foes?" and the robber bowed his
head, and replied&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is even so, Atheling of the West Saxons. When
foes carry fire and sword, ill it becomes the children
of the land to do so also."</p>

<p>"Spoken like a man," cried the Prince. "Go and
call thy men hither, and we will see that there is work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>enough for each and all. And for thee, Wanderer"&mdash;and
the Prince turned to Wulnoth&mdash;"good is the gift
thou hast given me, and good the service thou hast done
me; so come thou, and let us talk, and receive thou the
thanks of the Lady Osburga, my mother." And, thus
saying, Prince Alfred took Wulnoth's arm and led him
away.</p>

<p>Now, this is how Wulnoth met the masterless men,
and how he saved the life of Alfred, the Atheling of the
West Saxons.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />

<small><em>How the Men of Wessex fought the
Danes</em></small></h2>


<p>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_193.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">R</span>ight heartily did Alfred
welcome Wulnoth after he
had heard his story, and
warm were the words of
praise which he spoke of
Wahrmund the Dane; and
of him he said these words&mdash;</p>

<p>"Greater love hath no
man than this, that a man
lay down his life for his
friend." And when Wulnoth heard that he answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, that is a true word and a wise, O Prince.
What great scald or redesman uttered that?"</p>

<p>"The greatest Scald and the greatest Redesman
that ever this world saw, O friend," answered the Prince.
"That is one of the sayings of the Lord Jesus."</p>

<p>"Now," said Wulnoth, "I cannot understand, but
everything good and true seems to come from Him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Whom thou thinkest a nithing, O friend," answered
the Atheling. And Wulnoth was silenced.</p>

<p>And with the Atheling there tarried his mother
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>Osburga, the wife of the noble Ethelwulf&mdash;a gracious
lady, so full of sympathy and wisdom, with mild, beautiful
eyes that yet had a light in them as of a sorrow
never forgotten; for grief had been hers, though she
was a king's wife and the mother of kings.</p>

<p>Here also was Asser, the writer, and Alfred's bosom
friend, and Ealdorman Ethelred, and Osric, both mighty
warriors and great heroes, and with them Abbot Hugoline,
and Bishop Eadred; and these wise ones talked
much of holy things, and Wulnoth listened and learnt
much, and asked many questions.</p>

<p>And best of all, while he tarried with the Prince
there came Wyborga and Edgiva, together with holy
women from the church on the island, saying that they
had fled because the Danes were moving and pressing
forward into Wessex, carrying fire and sword with
them.</p>

<p>Sweet were the moments which Wulnoth spent with
his Princess, yet brief were they, for there was much
work to do, and he and his companions, the fifty nameless
men, were busy marching hither and thither, and
calling on all the men in the place to take their arms
and gather at the King's command beneath the banner
of the Atheling.</p>

<p>Every day there were martial exercises, and those
who were least skilled with the bow or at casting the
spear had to work from morning until night; for, as
Alfred said to them, "They needed to be men who
could slay&mdash;not men who were ready to be slain only."</p>

<p>Now between the Atheling and all his soldiers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>even to the lowest, was there friendship, and not one
but could be sure of being received and listened to did
he wish to speak to his Prince. And each day more and
more men came in, and the forces under the Prince's
command grew larger.</p>

<p>But one day did Alfred speak with Wulnoth, and
he said to him&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wanderer, not only brave men and skilled warriors
do we need to defeat these Danes. We need what
they have, and what our fathers on the other side of
the sea had&mdash;good ships, stout ships, long ships that
can match the best of theirs. Upon the sea must we
learn to meet them and so keep the fire from our land."</p>

<p>"Why indeed, Prince, that is the very word which
my comrade Wahrmund spake to me upon the day on
which we first sighted these shores&mdash;'Not till they
learn to fight us upon the sea shall they hope to beat
us.'"</p>

<p>"He spoke a true word," replied the Prince thoughtfully,
"and if God spare me I will see that this England
of ours has such ships&mdash;the best that can be built.
I will see that since the seas wash our shores, of those
seas shall she reign mistress."</p>

<p>Such was Alfred's vow, and afterwards, when he
was king, in face of such difficulties as might have well
appalled the stoutest heart, he kept his word and built
his ships, and beat the Danes at their own game upon
the deep waters.</p>

<p>But that is not for now&mdash;now we have to tell how
that first battle was waged against the Black Strangers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>in which they were to learn that there were other swords
as sharp as their own and other hearts as brave.</p>

<p>For messenger came after messenger, speeding to
Alfred and saying that unless he advanced to meet the
foe they would penetrate to Winchester itself, where
the King's house was. So Alfred sent messages to the
King, urging him to come and lead the battle in person
lest the glory should be taken from him. For Alfred,
though he was wiser and braver than his elder brother,
never forgot that brother was his king, and in all things
he honored him and gave him willing service.</p>

<p>So King Ethelred marched, and all his host with
him, and they joined forces with the Atheling where
he tarried; and the Lady Osburga, and Elswitha, Alfred's
wife, and the Lady Edgiva, and all their train,
retired with a small guard towards Winchester, for
though they were brave enough to face the perils
of war, their presence would have but hindered the
army, and given increased cause for care to its leaders.</p>

<p>Sad was the parting, and yet joyful, for these
brave Saxon ladies cheered the warriors and urged
them to great deeds, and sang to them songs of how
they were going to free their dear England from the
power of the oppressor. And then, with many prayers
and with smiling lips and tearful eyes, they parted
and went their way, while the King and the Atheling
caused their banners to be displayed and marched
to the eastward to meet the Danes under Hungwar and
King Bacseg.</p>

<p>For tidings came that Hubba and Biorn Ironbeard,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>and others had gone northward; and Guthrun stayed
at the old camp, awaiting the return of the ships, for
since the matter of Wulnoth and the killing of Wahrmund
there had been quarrels amongst the holdas, and
they parted one from the other.</p>

<p>Still, it was the main force that was now advancing
into Wessex, and many were the chiefs of fame accompanying
it.</p>

<p>The Saxon force was nothing like as numerous, but
so great was the charm of Alfred that all there held
together, forgetting their private quarrels and seeking
only each to aid the great business of making the land
free once more.</p>

<p>The King had seen Wulnoth and had greeted him
well, and though he did look askance at the nameless
ones, he was glad of their presence, and he said
with a laugh that since Wulnoth had brought them,
Wulnoth must be responsible for them; and so, while
their own captain led them, Wulnoth was their commander;
and because he himself was nameless and landless,
the robbers greeted him well and obeyed his
wishes, as otherwise they would not have done.</p>

<p>And they marched past the dreaded Welandes
Smithan, and the Atheling himself pointed out the spot
to Wulnoth and showed him the great flat stone on
which the silver penny must be laid, and he said that
none could tell by what power the shoeing was done,
but that the body of the Wise Wieland lay at rest beneath
those stones.</p>

<p>And other strange piles of stones they found on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>their march, each of which had some dreadful legend
of ghost or elfin power attached to it, but which, in
these days, we know to be only the tombs of a strange
people long since past away. And so, at last, they came
to a place called Ashdune, a wide sweeping plain, with
but one single tree in it, and that tree a great straggling
thorn bush, growing nigh the centre. And there, on the
verge of the plain, they encamped for the night, and
on the opposite side they could see the watch fires of
the invaders, and count their banners waving to the
wind.</p>

<p>Wild were the shouts from the Danish camp that
night, for the holdas drank deeply, as was their custom,
and they called out the names of their dead heroes, and
the songs were sung in their honor by the scalds as the
warriors drank to the war game and the sword song,
and vowed that with the rising of the sun they would
make an end of the men of Wessex, and lay the land
low in fire.</p>

<p>Such was the way in which Wulnoth had been
wont to spend the night before the battle, but in the
camp of the Saxons it was not so. Sparingly the soldiers
drank, and the Atheling took nothing but water;
and while watch was kept the Abbot Hugoline came
amongst the ranks and prayed, and the men knelt and
crossed their hands upon their breasts, and the monks
sang to Him Whom they called "The Lord God, great
and terrible, and mighty in battle"; and that made
Wulnoth the more perplexed, for he saw not how the
gentle Lord Christ could be terrible in battle.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>
<p>And then did he see Bishop Eadred all girt in
armor, and with a mighty mace in his hand, and thereat
he wondered more than ever, for he had not thought to
see a priest armed to fight like a warrior.</p>

<p>But the Bishop laughed and said, "Who should
fight for the Church but those who are her most loving
servants? Who should fight for the sheep against the
ravening wolves but those who are set over the flock
as shepherds?" And Wulnoth said to himself that
this Bishop was a man, and that he saw the service
of the White Christ did not make a man become a
nithing.</p>

<p>And also he looked at the Prince, and the Atheling
looked mighty in his war gear. Usually he looked pale,
seeing that he had a sickness which forever kept him
in pain; but now all thought of pain was gone, and
he laughed right joyously as he looked abroad at
the field whereon the battle would be waged, and he
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, truly, this is a sight for the heart of any
warrior, and great deeds will be done to-day, and yonder
heathen foe will be valiant. Yet remember, soldiers,
that we fight for much&mdash;not for life only, but for
freedom, for our hearths and families, for our wives,
our sisters, our mothers, and daughters. Strike for
them a good blow and true, and never let it be said of
one 'This man was a nithing.' See yonder"&mdash;and he
pointed across the plain&mdash;"see, there waves the magic
banner of Regner Lodbrok&mdash;there the raven of Odin
flaunts his wings. But here is the sign of the Lord,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>and he pointed to the cross which a priest held, "and
we will see which is mightier this day&mdash;Odin or our
Lord."</p>

<p>"Now," thought Wulnoth, "that is a sign, and we
will see, for truly the foe is the greater and should beat
us, for there are many holdas of fame there. Well, we
may see, and may I come near to Hungwar, Regner's
son, this day."</p>

<p>Then did the war-horns blare and shriek, and the
armies moved forward. And first the bowmen sent
their arrows hissing like hail, and many a barbed shaft
bit deeply and drank its fill of the red blood, but the
warriors held their shields and caught the arrows
thereon, and laughed, and no nithing was found in the
ranks of either side.</p>

<p>Then, as they drew nearer, the spears began to
hurtle through the air and join the arrows, and the
Valkyrs&mdash;those grim storm sisters who love the battlefield
and who wait to carry the souls of the heroes to the
storm-land&mdash;gathered, and floated above the field of
slaughter, where the thirsty earth already began to turn
red as the victims fell.</p>

<p>But this was but the beginning&mdash;the game was
hardly started&mdash;the fierce, mad sport was to come
later.</p>

<p>For now, sweeping forward, came ranks of champions
armed with axe, with sword, and shield, and they
ran to meet each other, and the strokes fell like hail, and
the pikes gored like the horns of angry bulls.</p>

<p>Now Wulnoth had schooled his men, and they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>drew together in shape like a wedge, with Wulnoth and
the captain at the point of it; and so a long line of
shields linked each to each, a long line of axes rising
and falling, or swinging upwards from beneath, they
drove into the heart of the Danish ranks, and then,
opening out, swept the vikings into a mass of struggling
disordered men, who hardly had room to move and who
mixed friend with foe in their fury.</p>

<p>Oh, great were the deeds done that day, and truly
did the Atheling behave like a hero in the fight as he led
his men, crying encouragement, pressing wherever the
game was the hottest, and seeming to be in a score of
places at once.</p>

<p>And bravely fought the King, and he singled out
the great Danish champion, King Bacseg, and he called
to him and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Greeting, King! I would fain talk with thee."
And thereat did the Dane laugh and answer&mdash;</p>

<p>"Greeting! Blithely will I listen to thy talk."</p>

<p>Then these twain fell to, and they smote each other
lusty blows and made their swords sing a loud song;
yet the King of Wessex was the mightier in the conflict,
and he smote King Bacseg to the ground, and smote yet
again, crying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Die, thou fell pirate of Denmark! Die, and let
this good English soil find thee a resting-place."</p>

<p>Now, this took place nigh to the thorn bush, and
there was a rush of the Danes to rescue the body of
their dead King, so that King Ethelred was borne backward,
and was like to have been slain himself but that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>Wulnoth and his fifty came sweeping down, and formed
a wall between the King and the foe.</p>

<p>Then thither hastened all the mighty ones of both
sides. There stood Bishop Eadred, and his mace dripped
with Danish blood; and there stood Ethelred the Ealdorman,
and Osric; and there, against them, as the
waves rush against the rocks, came the heroes of Denmark.
There came Sidroc the elder, and his son; there
came Osbern and Frena; there also came Oskettle and
Harold, and not one of them but had made his name
a terror, and had carried fire and sword to many a fair
spot; and now they came raging towards the spot
where the body of King Bacseg lay, crying for vengeance
against his slayer.</p>

<p>And thither also came Hungwar, foaming like a
bear and rolling his angry eyes, and behind him rose
the banner of Regner. And when Wulnoth saw him
he cried aloud&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ho, tarry, thou Danish pirate, thou killer of children.
For now I will give thee such a greeting as thou
hast never had before. I have a message to thee from
the dead King of Lethra, and from Wahrmund my
friend, and thou hast still the mark of my weapon upon
thy face. Stay, Hungwar! I call to thee to stay, as I
called to Osbert in the days of old!"</p>

<p>And Hungwar heard, and he raged like a berserker,
but he came not to Wulnoth, for in his heart he feared
him more than all the warriors of Wessex.</p>

<p>And now the fight went against the Danes, and
Bishop Eadred smote down Sidroc the elder, and Osric
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>smote down Sidroc the younger and Oskettle. And
Ethelred the King, he smote Frena; and Alfred the
Atheling laid Osbern low.</p>

<p>And all around that thorn tree the dead lay piled
high like unto a wall, Saxon and Dane, still clutching
each other in the last fierce hand-grips of death. And
the fighters were weary with slaughter and the swords
tired of their song. And then, for the first time in
any decisive battle since their landing, the Danes
broke and retreated, and Hungwar led them, galloping
off on his war-horse and waving his arms as if the
evil spirit had entered into him. And so ended the
battle, and the Saxons were the masters of the field of
slaughter.</p>

<p>And yet it was at great cost, for many were slain,
and while the Danes could bring a score for each one
dead, the men of Wessex were few, and the men of
Mercia and Northumbria were jealous of them, and
would have joyed to see them beaten, and would not
come to their aid.</p>

<p>So back went the King and the Atheling and their
soldiers, and the eagles and the crows gathered over the
field of slaughter, and the wolf howled for joy from the
forest as he called his brethren to the feast, smelling
the blood from afar.</p>

<p>But Wulnoth looked to where, far away, he saw the
Raven of Odin in retreat, and he looked to the cross
which the priests carried before the army, and he remembered
his words and felt that the White Christ
was the strongest, and that they who served Him were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>no nithings, when it came to making the sword sing
and playing the man's game.</p>

<p>Now, this is how the Danes were beaten by the
Saxons of Wessex on the field of slaughter which is
called Ashdune, and this is how the Raven of Odin fled
from the sign of the White Christ.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />

<small><em>The Passing of Ethelred the King</em></small></h2>

<p>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_205.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">N</span>ow, though the men of Wessex
had beaten the Danes
with a great slaughter at
the battle of Ashdune, little
rest did the weary land have
from the war-song, but day
by day the sword gleamed
and the red flames roared,
and the Black Strangers
came in foraying bands.</p>

<p>Like the leaves before the wind, like the snow on
the northern blast, so did the Danes seem to gather,
until even the boldest and the bravest felt their hearts
fail, and asked each other what could be done to free
the land from these savage, barbarian invaders, who
seemed like to swamp the whole world and plunge it
back into paganism again.</p>

<p>And now the men of Mercia, and those of Northumbria
and Cantua, had occasion to lament that they had
not joined with Wessex, and, forgetting their own quarrels,
striven side by side against the common foe. For
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>to every part of the fair land the Danes marched, and
their pathway was death and ruin, and of them the
English said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Of what use is it to war against them, for if there
be thirty thousand slain to-day, there will be twice
thirty thousand in their place to-morrow?"</p>

<p>Yet, for all that, did Ethelred the King, and Alfred
his brother, fight as brave men should, calling upon all
their men to trust in the Lord and be of good cheer;
and, whilst in other parts of the land the invaders were
striking terror to all hearts, in the land of the West
Saxons they were frequently driven back and put to
flight.</p>

<p>But it was hard work and sad; for the hands of the
strongest must grow weary, and the hearts of the
mightiest must fail sometimes; and there was no rest
for King or for Prince. To-day they would face the foe
in one place, and the next they would be in rapid
march to strike an unexpected blow in quite another
direction.</p>

<p>But the land wept, for there was no corn sown and
no harvest to reap, because men said that there was
little wisdom in sowing fields that were to be trampled
down in the war game, or in storing in barns, through
which the red flames might leap.</p>

<p>Oh! those were sad days, when hunger and despair
and battle were on every hand; and still, on and
on the Danes pressed, and their long ships were on
every coast and barring all the rivers, and even floating
up to London itself.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>
<p>And a merry game did Wulnoth and his robber
companions play, though alas, now of that fifty but half
remained. To-day here, to-morrow there, hurrying at
the King's behest, enduring fatigue and peril with
laughter, and doing hero deeds that rivalled the best of
the Danish holdas' achievements.</p>

<p>Little of Edgiva did Wulnoth see in those days, but
at night, when he rested with his band in the forest
depths, or lay counting the watchful stars, then he
would think of his Princess, and in fancy see her face,
and he would dream a good dream of the days that
should be, when England was England once more.</p>

<p>Yet never did he forget the friend of his boyhood
and the promise he had made; and he wondered when
and how he should ever obtain tidings of Guthred the
Prince.</p>

<p>"I can go but one step at a time," he murmured
to himself. "This helping of Alfred is the first thing,
and afterwards we will think of what may follow it."
And then he would sit by the watch fire, while his rough
companions lay around; and he would think, and think,
of the White Christ, and the wonder story of His great
love, and His death on the cross; and now he no longer
called it a nithing tale, but thought it beautiful as the
best of the sagas; and though he said naught of it to
any, nor even let Edgiva know when he saw her, Wulnoth
was beginning to understand, and to see that the
Lord Christ was the mightiest, and the greatest, and
the best, and indeed the very Bretwalda of all the
angels.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>
<p>But little time was there for thinking even on
that matter; for it was fight, fight, day by day; now
hunted, and now hunting&mdash;at this moment the Raven
of Odin victorious, and the next the banner of Ethelred
triumphant.</p>

<p>And in one battle did the forces meet at a place
called Merton, not far from Ashdune; and there, while
they strove, and now to one side now to the other the
victory inclined, Ethelred the King was smitten by a
spear, and fell wounded from his horse; and Wulnoth,
and Osric, and Alfred, raised him up tenderly, and bore
him from the field of slaughter, and then rushed back
and threw themselves upon the foe, fighting fiercely
until, when the evening shadows came, the Danes were
glad to retire; for they had met with those who could
strive as well as themselves.</p>

<p>And then did the Saxons take their wounded King;
and, commanded by Alfred, they retreated swiftly and
silently, and with hearts bowed down by sadness, so
that they might find a place where the King could rest
in safety.</p>

<p>And then did the King call his brother the Atheling
to his side, and he spoke with him tenderly, and bade
him be comforted.</p>

<p>"How could man die better than face to foe, striving
for his country, and for the blessed Truth, dear
brother?" he said. "Now I am wounded sore, and my
spirit tells me that I shall die; and for that my heart rejoices,
for by dying shall I gain a better crown than one
of earthly power, and by death shall I enter into life."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>
<p>And Alfred bowed his head and wept, for his heart
was very sore now; and Wulnoth stood by, for his it
was to guard the King's tent, and he wondered yet more
and more; for here was a second King dying, and he
also, like as Edmund had done, spoke of victory and life,
and seemed glad and happy, and not like those of the
Danes and the Old Saxons, who only spoke of going
to the dark storm-land.</p>

<p>But they could not tarry long where the King lay,
for the foe pressed too hard; and so they hurried southwards,
and the army broke into small parties, that they
might travel the more swiftly and securely. And so they
came south by Winchester, the King's town, and even
there they did not stay, but passed on into the land of
Durnovaria, or as we now call it Dorchester. And there
did the King tarry, for he was too sick to journey farther,
though there was some talk of reaching the sea,
and sending him afar into safety. But his wounds were
bad, and his strength was gone, and his mind weary
for his kingdom, and for the land at large, and for the
faith of the Lord; and he knew that he must soon pass
hence, and be at peace.</p>

<p>And to him came his aged mother Osburga, whom
neither grief, nor peril, nor weariness could conquer;
and she, and the Abbot Hugoline, and Alfred, they
tended the King in his last hours of pain and sorrow,
and whispered words of good cheer to him, while Osric,
and Ethelred the Ealdorman, went back with the forces,
and made another stand against the foe, who pursued
hard upon their track.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>
<p>And there did King Ethelred breathe his last, and
commit his soul into the keeping of his Saviour; and
from there did they carry his body to the minster at
Wimborne, and there did they bury the King.</p>

<p>And Alfred the Atheling had the crown placed upon
his head, and became Alfred the King; and of all Saxon
Kings, did he prove the best, and the bravest, and the
wisest; so that in after days his fame was sung and he
was called "The Great Thane" and "The Bretwalda of
the English" and "The Shepherd of his people."</p>

<p>Yet on that very day whereon he was crowned did
Wulnoth the Wanderer come upon him in the church;
and lo, he knelt, and he prayed, and as he prayed he
wept; and Wulnoth spoke with the King, for Alfred
made a friend of the Wanderer, and he asked him why
he wept.</p>

<p>"Thou art King now, and thou hast a kingdom,
and thou hast men to fight, and thou thyself art a
warrior; wherefore, then, dost thou weep, O King?"</p>

<p>"Heavy is it to be a King, friend," the monarch
answered, "and weary is the land wherein battle is
ever raging; and great is the stewardship which I have.
Therefore, I kneel in humbleness, and with tears I ask
Him for help and for grace, that I may do my work and
receive my reward."</p>

<p>"O King!" cried Wulnoth. "If thy God is the
mightiest of gods, why does he not drive out the Danes,
and scatter their host? I am puzzled, of a truth, O
King, for I understand not this thing."</p>

<p>"And couldst thou understand all God's ways, then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>wouldst thou be as wise as God. Does the warrior
understand all his captain's plans? Nay, he receives
his order, and he obeys his command, and he trusts his
captain enough to know that each order is given for a
reason. So is it with us, O Wanderer. We trust and
we obey, and the end is with Him. His ways are
greater than our ways, and His thoughts than our
thoughts."</p>

<p>Sad and solemn was the crowning of the King, for
there was no pomp and stately show now, as there had
been of yore. Scarcely had he thanes to stand around
him; scarcely had he people to aid him; there was no
time for such empty things as pageant now; for almost
ere the body of King Ethelred was laid to its rest, there
came tidings of new and fresh hosts of Danes sweeping
over the land.</p>

<p>And bitter was it for Mercia then; for the Black
Strangers became as a terror to the bravest, and all men
trembled at their name.</p>

<p>Across the country to Lindum<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> they swept; and
from the sea other hosts poured into the land. They
attacked and drove out King Burhred, and placed one
named Ceolwulf in his place, as under-lord. Black and
bitter was the treason of Ceolwulf the Thane, who had
been Burhred's thane; for he, a Saxon, became a servant
of the Danes; and of him it is said that he was
fiercer than his masters, so that the land was laid waste.</p>

<p>And farther north, in Northumbria, the whole land
was covered with the foe; and there Halfdane, whom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>some called Hungwar's brother, led his forces and destroyed
without ruth as he went, burning every church
and monastery, and even the beautiful cathedral of
Lindisfarne; and while the flames roared, and the
sword sang, the wail of women, and the shriek of tortured
little children, rose to mingle with it, and hope
and faith died out in the land.</p>

<p>But down in Wessex, still the light shone, and still
brave hearts resisted; though often it was hard and
bitter work, and from being able to stand before the
Danes, the forces frequently had to hurry, driven from
place to place, yet ever inspired by the King to fresh
courage and endeavor.</p>

<p>And in those days did Wulnoth do mighty deeds,
and earn himself a name amongst men, for being a hero;
so that the Danes knew and feared; and Hungwar himself
trembled; for he knew that the day would come
when he and Wulnoth would meet face to face; and
then it would be a bitter day and dark for him.</p>

<p>Now, this is how King Ethelred was wounded in
battle, and died of his wounds; and this is how the
crown passed to Alfred the Atheling, and the whole
land, from north to south, was overrun by the Black
Strangers, and given to fire and sword.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<small><em>Of the Coming back of Guthrun</em></small></h2>


<p>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_213.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">N</span>ow, for nigh five years after
King Alfred was crowned,
did the land groan beneath
the sword of the invaders;
and everywhere there was
battle; for when the Danes
had none other to fight, then
did they fight amongst themselves.
And for nigh five
years did Wulnoth lead
amongst the King's chosen champions, and beat the
foe back.</p>

<p>Seven years now had the Wanderer been in England,
and yet he had gained no tidings of Guthred the
Prince. Edgiva he saw several times, and sweet were
their greetings, and dear the hours they spent together;
but all too brief the time that was theirs.</p>

<p>Beautiful, with a wondrous beauty, was Edgiva
now; and yet, though beautiful and a King's daughter,
she was true to her lover, and would listen to no other
suitors.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>
<p>Yet still she would not give him her hand, nor did
he ask it; for not yet had he owned that the Lord Christ
was the greatest and noblest of all, and not yet was the
land at rest; and Edgiva would not have him think of
aught save his duty to his King and to the land.</p>

<p>"Oh! Wulnoth, my hero," she would say to him,
"hard is thy task, but truly thou dost do it. And
Wyborga, who grows wiser as she grows older, reveals
to me that harder yet shall it be; and the King shall
flee as a nameless man and a landless man, and thou
shalt abide with him. But be brave, for through it all
shalt thou come to victory and honor."</p>

<p>Then did Wulnoth kiss her fair hand, and answer,
and say&mdash;"My Princess, I am thy watcher and thy
servant, as I am thy faithful lover, and all that thou
dost command, that will I strive to do."</p>

<p>Thus did the days pass and grow to years, and the
years grew until five had passed; and then came Guthrun
and a mighty host, marching towards Exeter, near
which city the King lay with his forces. And when the
army started to march, then from the mouth of the
Thames their fleet sailed to the West, and from the sides
of the long ships gleamed the shields of many warriors.</p>

<p>Now, the King of the West Saxons heard news of
the marching of Guthrun's host, and of the sailing of the
long ships, and he called his thanes and captains to
counsel, and he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now we have two forces to meet, one by land and
one by sea. Those on land march to Exeter, and those
by sea will seek to land at the nearest spot."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>
<p>"Wise are the Danes, O King," answered Wulnoth
bitterly. "They know the weakest spot at which to
strike. For this Exeter, is it not now menaced by the
Britons from West Wales, and will they not help our
foes?"</p>

<p>"We must trust in the mercy of the Lord, Wanderer,"
the King answered. "Would to God that all
the inhabitants of this unhappy land would fight as
brethren. We should soon thrust the Danes out then."<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>"Little good to wish that, O King," cried one gaunt
old warrior. And the King smiled.</p>

<p>"Ay, we will not waste time in idle wishes. Now
this is my rede. Thou knowest that I have caused to be
built long ships, like those which the Danes use. Now
these lie at the coast towns; and I counsel that we man
them and put to sea, and there trust to our God to give
us the victory over this foe."</p>

<p>"And, meantime, the foe on land, O King?" cried
Wulnoth.</p>

<p>"They will have reached the city, Wanderer, and
there will they surely tarry, seeking perchance to make
league with the Britons, and waiting for their friends
to join them. Now mark you&mdash;if we are favored by
Heaven, and can defeat the ships, we will play their
own game. We will land from our ships and sweep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>towards Exeter, and give the city to the flame, and put
them to the sword."</p>

<p>"By the bracelets of Odin, King," laughed Wulnoth,
"thou art marking out a big task for thyself. But
if this is in thy mind, I for one am well content to try
it; and methinks I shall love to feel the ships leap over
the waves, and to join in a sea-fight again."</p>

<p>So, all the thanes agreeing, the King and his forces
hurried southward and got to their ships, and were
ready to go on board and set sail, as soon as the foe
appeared.</p>

<p>And presently, from afar, the sails appeared, and
the hearts of some sank as they saw the number; yet
the King prayed to Heaven for help, and made haste to
prepare for battle.</p>

<p>In years long after, there was another little fleet of
ships not so far from that very spot, waiting while
a mighty armada came, stately and confident, up the
Channel; and what happened then, happened also in
the reign of Alfred the King.</p>

<p>For, as the fleet of Danish warships drew near, dark
clouds gathered in the sky, and the tempest roared, and
the wind blew, and the great waves grew, and thundered
against the white cliffs, and the King pointed
and cried&mdash;</p>

<p>"See, O friends, Heaven does not desert us; and
what we are too weak to do, that God does in the
strength of His might. Look, and doubt no more."</p>

<p>And indeed it seemed as if the King's words were
true, for the Danish ships were caught by the tempest,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>and the great sails were rent, and the strong masts
shivered, and many were engulfed, and others dashed
on the rocks; and the remainder turned to flee, and
were pursued by Alfred's ships, and vanquished; and
thus it happened that for the first time the Saxons of
Wessex gained a sea-fight, and taught the proud invaders
a lesson.</p>

<p>Then did Alfred and his soldiers hasten back to
Exeter; and there they found Guthrun and his host,
and they set a siege about the city, and put the Danes
into a hard case; so that Guthrun besought Alfred to
make peace with him, and he swore by the bracelets of
Odin, and by the hammer of Thor, that he would keep
truce.</p>

<p>"Now," said Wulnoth, when he heard of this, "if
thou art counselled by me, O King, thou wilt make no
truce here. Thou hast them in thy hand, and I would
make an end of them. The pledge of a Dane is as a
rune written on the sand. You may search for it, and
it will not be found."</p>

<p>But the King was so noble that he believed not
that a holda like Guthrun would break his word; and,
moreover, he was afraid to tarry long before the city,
for fear he should be cut off by other bands who might
come. So a truce was signed, and the Danes departed
from the neighborhood, and for a little while the land
had peace, and the King busied himself in building more
long ships in case of need.</p>

<p>But soon the King was to learn that Wulnoth was
right when he said the Danes were not to be trusted,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>for suddenly after a few months, and when the Winter
held all the land in its iron grip, and food was hard to
come by for the soldiers; back, sweeping like a flame
over the land, came Guthrun and Hungwar with him,
and a vast force, greater than ever; and Guthrun and
Hungwar had sworn by Thor, that they would make
an end of Alfred, who had worried and resisted them
so long, when all the other Saxon kings had bowed to
their sway.</p>

<p>And tidings were brought to the King as he sat in
his hall, and then did Wulnoth laugh and say&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, O King, if there is any power in thy God,
let it be shown; for this time there will be no mistake.
Hungwar and Guthrun have made friends again, and
they march together, and I tell thee that from end to
end of thy kingdom they will leave nothing but ruin
and death. Thou shouldst have crushed the head while
thou hadst it in thy power to do so, and then perchance
the tail would have died. Now head and tail are joined,
and there comes a terror to the land, O King. Of a
truth there comes a terror."</p>

<p>"Let us not meet trouble till it comes, Wanderer,"
the King answered. "Ho! my thanes, go forth and
summon me all my bands&mdash;all who can bear war gear
and carry lance&mdash;and this time, as the Wanderer says,
an end shall be made."</p>

<p>So the thanes went forth, and they came back with
a sad tale, which they told with hanging heads. The
fear of the foe was in all the land, and men were weary
of being harried and marched to war, and every one was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>fleeing. Churls and thralls, thanes and sethcundmen,
all alike had gone, fleeing. Many of them had gone
across the narrow waters to the island beyond&mdash;the
Isle of Wight&mdash;while others bowed in submission to
the invaders; and Alfred the King found himself a
King without a people, with hardly any whom he could
look to, with his best soldiers melting away, as the snow
melts when the sun shines upon it.</p>

<p>Oh! bitter was it to the King, and bitter was it to
the brave hearts who loved him; for now it seemed
as if the kingdom of Wessex would share the fate of
the rest of the land, and groan under the rod of the
pagan.</p>

<p>And then spake Wulnoth again, and he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now up and let us act, for these Danes will give us
little rest if they once come up with us; and though
I fear not death, I have somewhat to do ere I close my
eyes. I have a word for Hungwar, and I have a quest
to make. Come, King, and come, comrades, and never
be discouraged. We must flee for the time, but it will
not be forever that we are to remain hidden.</p>

<p>"The sun may be hidden by a cloud for the time,
O King, but it is not lost forever."</p>

<p>"But what shall we do with our dear ones, our
tender ones?" cried the King. "With whom shall we
leave them?"</p>

<p>"With whom dost thou think they will tarry, son,
save with those they love?" answered Osburga, speaking
stoutly. "Do we fear the cold, and the wet, more
than the risk of being taken by the wicked Danes? Nay,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>son, I, thy mother, go with thee, for one; and so does
thy royal spouse Elswitha, and her attendant, the Lady
Edgiva, herself a royal princess."</p>

<p>"This may not be," cried the King; but the others
said that the words were wise words, and that so they
would have less care than if the Queen were left unprotected
and alone.</p>

<p>So by night a little army, such a poor little force,
was gathered; and with the Queen, and Osburga, and
Edgiva, and old Wyborga, they journeyed by forest and
wild, and on till they came to a wild and desolate place<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
where two angry streams met, with wild moors and
dreary swamps extending for many a mile, over which
none might with safety pass, unless they knew the pathways
that were sure.</p>

<p>And here in this desolate place did the King, who
now had no hall, abide in humble huts which they built
with their own hands; and often did he and those with
him have no food, unless they first caught it by their
own skill.</p>

<p>Fish they snared from the waters, and wild deer
they chased across the moor, and they lived like outlaws
and nameless ones. Hard was it then for the King, and
sorely did he grieve for the unhappy land; for ever and
again his spies came with reports of the grievous work
of the Danes, and of the suffering of the people, and his
heart was full of pain. Scarce could he go from his
hiding-place because of the foe, for he knew that they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>were gathering closer and closer, searching for him to
make an end of him.</p>

<p>Sometimes he had to wander quite alone, without a
single attendant, and dressed in the poorest garments of
a churl, and yet never in all did the faith of the King
fail, and never did his mother or his wife fail him in his
need.</p>

<p>Now the King had a jewel<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> which he valued, and
which he hung round his neck; and this was a stone of
polished crystal, two inches long, and cunningly wrought
with gold and green enamel; and seated thereon was a
figure with a lily spray in each hand, and surrounding
the jewel was a gold band on which were written these
words&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alfred mec heht gewyrcan.</span> (Alfred had me
made).</p></div>

<p>And in his wanderings amidst the bogs and the fens,
this jewel was lost, so that the King grieved sore, and
said it was a bad omen, and that his kingdom was lost
to him also.</p>

<p>But Wyborga came, and spoke, and her words
were heard by all, and she said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Grieve not for the thing which is lost, O King,
for in other days will it be found. Rather rejoice, for
thou shalt have a better jewel than that which is lost,
and thy crown shall yet shine bright, and thy fame
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>remain for all time, so that no hero shall have more
renown and none do better deeds."</p>

<p>"Thou dost speak good words, Wyborga," answered
the King, but now he spoke a little wearily.
"May they come true!" And Wyborga answered,
"They will surely come true."</p>

<p>"Wyborga, didst thou say that to comfort the King
only?" asked Wulnoth, when he saw the wise woman
alone. And she smiled&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wulnoth, have not all my words come true to
thee? But now I have a work for thee to do, and a
journey for thee to go, seeing that here the King needs
thee not."</p>

<p>"What is thy work, Wyborga?" asked Wulnoth,
"and whither must I journey?"</p>

<p>"Take with thee of thy band those who are left to
the King," the old woman said, "and journey thou
southward towards the sea."</p>

<p>"For what purpose, O Wyborga?" he asked. And
she explained&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wulnoth, I have seen a vision; and in the vision
I beheld long ships come over the sea; and in one of
them floated the raven banner of Regner, and beneath
it stood Hubba, and Biorn Ironsides, who have returned
from their work in Mercia. I saw these ships come to
shore, and I saw a band of heroes, and thee amongst
them; and the banner of Regner fell to thee, and Hubba
was slain, and the Danes fled. Go now, and see how
this may be, for methinks the vision was sent to me,
that I might tell thee, and that the work might begin.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>The King's exile shall soon be done, and the darkness
shall flee away."</p>

<p>"Now by my beard," Wulnoth cried, "this is the
best news thou hast told me for many a day, and right
gladly do I go to do thy bidding."</p>

<p>"Tell not the King," the wise woman said, "else
he may desire to come with thee, and evil may come of
it. Go thou, Wulnoth, and may success be thine; and
I will make excuse to the King for thine absence."</p>

<p>So Wulnoth called to his companions, and they
started off on their journey; and the heart of Wulnoth
beat high with hope, and he felt that Wyborga's word
would be a true word, and that he would slay Hubba,
and capture the famous raven banner, which struck
terror to the hearts of all men.</p>

<p>Now, this is how Guthrun the Dane came again
with his host and forced the King to flee, and this is
how Wulnoth started for Devonshire at the bidding of
Wyborga the Wise Woman.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />

<small><em>Of the Capturing of the Raven Banner</em></small></h2>


<p>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_224.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">N</span>ow, away went Wulnoth
and his companions, of whom
but twenty now remained,
but of that twenty not one
but was a warrior indeed,
proved in many a fight.</p>

<p>Fully armed were they,
and in the best of spirits,
since the Wanderer had told
them that he was going to
seek adventure and glory, and the man's game; and
they were weary of hiding amidst the marshes, like
herons in pools.</p>

<p>After leaving Athelney, they crossed into a dense
forest; and here, in one of the glades, they came across
a party of Danes, who evidently were searching for the
King.</p>

<p>The Black Strangers were resting, and their horses
grazed near by; but when they saw Wulnoth and his
men they sprang up, seizing their weapons, and bidding
the comrades stand and declare their business.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>
<p>"Ye are nameless men it seems," the leader said
sternly, "and therefore we have no desire to do ye any
harm. But say, have ye heard aught of the hiding-place
of this Saxon King, Alfred, for him do we search for."</p>

<p>"I think," began Wulnoth, then he stopped; and
the leader demanded what it was that he thought.</p>

<p>"Well, I think that we are weary, having to walk
while ye have horses," the Wanderer made reply.
"Moreover, I think 't is a shame that Saxons should
walk, while Danish thieves ride, especially when they
ride Saxon horses which they have stolen."</p>

<p>"How, knave!" roared the viking leader. And
Wulnoth laughed&mdash;</p>

<p>"I think, moreover," he went on, "that we will
have those horses; and as the land will be well quit of
such pirates, we will slay you, ere we go on our way.
To the game, Danes! to the game! for there are blows
to be dealt."</p>

<p>Then his own men drew their weapons, and the
Danes, nothing loath, made ready also; and the leader
said to Wulnoth&mdash;</p>

<p>"Since thou hast talked so much, I will speak a
word to thee, and it shall be thy message to the storm-land."</p>

<p>"Speak then," laughed Wulnoth, and he raised
his axe, and smote a mighty stroke, and the Dane fell
stricken, as an ox falls before the flesher's blow.</p>

<p>And then did the fight commence, but it was not
long; for Wulnoth was as a berserker now, and he
smote such blows as none could withstand, so that soon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>the Danes were in flight, and the band had horses and
casting-spears, and were speeding on their way again.</p>

<p>"By Thor! 't is more pleasant to ride than to walk,"
laughed Wulnoth, "and when it is riding on a good
Saxon nag taken from a Danish thief, why, then 't is
doubly enjoyable." And at that the others laughed gleefully,
as they cantered on.</p>

<p>Green and fresh were the woods, and fair to look
upon; but the eyes flashed and the brows frowned, when
the band left the woods and rode across the country, and
saw homestead after homestead burnt and ruined, and
the bodies of the murdered ones left there for the birds
and the wolves to feed upon.</p>

<p>It has been laid to Alfred's charge that he showed
no mercy to his prisoners when he captured the crews
of two warships that had been driven ashore; but in
truth there was little call, or room, for mercy, for the
Danes had made sure of their work, and left only revenge
in the hearts of men.</p>

<p>And as the companions rode on in something of
gloomy silence, feeling as though these sights of desolation
fell iron-heavy on their hearts, suddenly from
afar came the shrill shriek of a woman in pain or fear,
and the sounds of strife; and Wulnoth placed a finger
to his lips in warning, and galloped quietly forward in
the direction of the sound, followed by his companions;
and each man loosened his sword, or grasped his spear,
while there came into their eyes a look, like the hungry
light in the eyes of the starving wolf when he smells
blood from afar.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>
<p>And there they saw a cottage, with some dozen
Black Strangers before it; with an old man lying dead,
and his old wife panting her life away, while three of the
cruel ones were placing a noose around a young man's
neck, and some of the others were tying a fair maiden to
a tree, to use her for a target.</p>

<p>The Danes halted as they heard the horses dashing
forward, but little time had they to think, little time
even to defend themselves.</p>

<p>With a shrill Saxon shout the companions were
upon them, and the murderers were smitten down, not
one getting away to tell the tale; and then Wulnoth
sprang from his horse and lifted the poor old woman's
head, while the others speedily unfastened the girl and
set the youth free.</p>

<p>"How is this?" they asked. "What had you done
to offend them?" And the young man laughed bitterly.</p>

<p>"What had I done?" he cried. "Know you so little
of the Danes, as to think that one need do anything, for
them to make excuse for murdering? Our cottage
chanced to be in their way as they passed, that was
enough. They needed some sport, and what better sport
than burning and murdering?"</p>

<p>"Well, comrade, they have got sport of another
kind now," laughed Wulnoth, "though I fear they
have done mischief enough here; for this poor old dame
is surely dying."</p>

<p>"Poor mother," the young man said with a sob,
while the girl in silence bent over the dying woman.
"Yet 't is best for her to follow father; for since these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>Danes have come, 't has been naught but hunger, and
fear, and suffering; and now she will be at peace."</p>

<p>"Do you fight the Danes?"</p>

<p>The question was asked with terrible intensity, and
the men looked at the girl as, supporting the dying
woman, she glanced up&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ay, maiden, that is our business in life; and we
hope to do a little more of it, ere long."</p>

<p>"Then, Garth, go you with them. Go," and the girl
turned to the young man. "There is nothing for you
to do here. I and others will bury these poor bodies;
you, a man, need not tarry for that. Go, and let each
day see a Dane slain in memory of this work. Revenge
is sacred now. Go, brother."</p>

<p>"But you!" cried the young man to his sister.
"Besides, these warriors may not care for a youth to
be of their number."</p>

<p>"By Thor, that is wrong, lad. We will take all
the strong arms we can secure, and then we could do
with more. And if this maiden can care for herself for
the time, then we will take you. 'T is the work every
honest Saxon should be doing now."</p>

<p>"I can take care of myself; go you, Garth," and
she looked at the lad again.</p>

<p>Then did the young man come near to Wulnoth,
and he said in low tones&mdash;</p>

<p>"Stranger, who hast helped us, and slain our foes,
and who art going to fight the Danes, I also have made
up my mind to do that, and there are others of like mind,
only we lack leaders. Now, what would you say to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>hundred youths who can each shoot, and hit the clout
four times out of five?"</p>

<p>"What would I say!" cried Wulnoth heartily, "I
would say that they were worth their weight in gold at
this time. Boy, there is a King who needs to have his
crown placed firmly upon his head once more, and thy
hundred youths with their bows, might have much to
do with settling it there."</p>

<p>"I care less for the King than I do for revenge,"
was the fierce answer. "Ah! I know our good priest
would have told me that was wrong. Well, they have
killed him, and killed my love, and I want revenge. The
hundred shall be thine, if thou wilt tarry a few hours."</p>

<p>"We will wait," answered Wulnoth, "and while we
tarry we will aid the maiden to bury the dead. She
speaks like a redesman. That is her part. Thine it is
to strike blows."</p>

<p>The young man turned and disappeared amidst the
trees; and the companions in their rude yet kindly way
performed the solemn offices for the murdered man and
his wife, the poor old soul having breathed her last; and
then back came the lad Garth, and with him groups of
stout young fellows, sturdy carls who had fled from the
foe, and who, having no work now, thought but of one
thing&mdash;that one thing which all Saxons throughout the
land desired&mdash;<em>revenge</em>.</p>

<p>So that evening Wulnoth set forward again, with a
hundred of archers in his train, and they marched till
they came to a masterless band, and the leader put his
men in array and prepared for battle.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>
<p>But Wulnoth halted his force, and rode alone, and
gave the robber greeting, and spake to him and his men
of the wrong in the land, and the need that was, and
showed how his comrades were part of just such another
band; and the Saxon outlaws talked together, and
then threw in their lot with the Wanderer, so that now
he had a hundred archers, and sixty horsemen at his
back.</p>

<p>And into Devonshire they came; and there the stout
old Ealdorman Borric came out with his men, and demanded
who they were, and whither they journeyed,
and Wulnoth told him that they journeyed to the coast,
to watch for the coming of the foe, and oppose their
landing. And at that Borric laughed grimly, and looked
with bright eyes from beneath his shaggy brows.</p>

<p>"So thou wouldst oppose the Danes with thy handful!"
he cried. "Hast any idea of how many these
foes are?"</p>

<p>"I ought to have," answered Wulnoth coolly,
"since I came over with them, serving under Hungwar."
And at that the Ealdorman stared harder, and
said grimly&mdash;</p>

<p>"That word needs explaining, my friend."</p>

<p>So Wulnoth told him part of his story, and how he
had left the King, though he told not where the King
was. And Borric smote his hands together, and he
cried&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now thou dost shame us, Wanderer, since that
is what thou callest thyself. All too slack have we been
in this matter. We have sat still and let the foes come.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>Now I will send messengers throughout the land, and
we will see what force we can gather, and we will make
one fight, a good fight, and a true fight; and if we die
we die, and if we drive these vile pirates off, then we
will thank God for it."</p>

<p>"Now," thought Wulnoth, "this is strange! I set
out with a score, and not knowing where another would
come from; and here I am like to have an army ere long.
Truly there is something in Wyborga's rede to me."</p>

<p>So Wulnoth and his force, and some more who
joined them, pushed forward towards the coast; and
the people, as they went, joined them, for they were all
weary of the slaughter, and determined to make another
try to shake off the Danish yoke from the neck of
beautiful England.</p>

<p>And for days they waited, and each day brought
more and more strength, and each day Wulnoth, like a
wise leader, made his men exercise and keep watch;
and he placed beacons all along the coast, to give warning
if the foe came by night; and then, one day, as the
sun rose and scattered the white sea mist, they saw
coming down towards them, the long row of stately
long ships; and, as Wyborga had prophesied, there
floated the raven banner of Regner Lodbrok.</p>

<p>And at that some grew afraid, for they looked upon
the banner as being of magic powers; but Wulnoth
laughed and told them how he had seen it fleeing from
the field, and how it was foretold that it would be captured
in that very fight.</p>

<p>And now, in towards the shore the ships came, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>the Danish leaders stood and laughed right scornfully,
as they saw the Saxons drawn up to receive them; and
they cried&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tarry there, O Saxons. Tarry till we come, for
our swords are thirsty, and we lack foes to satisfy
them!" And then Wulnoth answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"Be sure that we will tarry, son of Regner. Be
sure of it, for we have journeyed long to reach here in
time; and also I have a word for thee which shall be
as my word to Wiglaf thy boxer, Hubba, thou nithing."</p>

<p>Then Hubba knew that it was the Wanderer who
spoke, and he turned to Biorn Ironbeard&mdash;him who
before had tried to cut the iron mace handle&mdash;and he
said, grimly&mdash;</p>

<p>"By Odin's twelve companions, Ironbeard, yonder
is that Wanderer of whom we have heard before. There
will be rough play where he stands." And Ironbeard
laughed with glee, and gave the word to lower the sails.</p>

<p>Down came the sails, and round came the ships;
and from their sides rained the arrows and the casting-spears;
but from the shore came others in reply, and
wherever the arrow of Garth sped, there a Dane went
to the storm-land on its point.</p>

<p>Then into the sea foam the warriors sprang, and
rushed forward with shields upraised and swords bare,
and the man's game began, and the wounded fell on
both sides. And there strode Biorn Ironbeard clearing
him a pathway with his wide-sweeping sword; and to
him went Borric the Ealdorman, and Borric took a
mighty mace, and he smote once, and Ironbeard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>staggered; and he smote twice, and Ironbeard fell on his
knees; and he smote yet again, and Ironbeard fell dead.</p>

<p>Then did the Saxons cry in triumph, and Wulnoth
shouted to the Ealdorman,&mdash;"Thou hast had thy prize,
O friend, may I also have mine!"</p>

<p>"And that thou shalt have, if I am thy prize,"
shouted Hubba, and he came striding on, his banner
behind him; and all the forces of the Danes, and the
people of the land met, and surged around, and for the
time drove them apart.</p>

<p>But then Wulnoth whirling an axe in either hand,
as he had been taught of old by Osth the giant, dashed
against the Danes, and they shrank back; for to them
he looked like a wild berserker, he raged so; and he
reached the place where the banner of Regner waved,
and with one blow he cut down the banner bearer, and
with another he smote back his champion watcher, and
then he hurled one axe away, and waved the banner
aloft, and cleaved himself a road through the Danes with
his weapon.</p>

<p>And then the vikings cried to Hubba that his banner
was stolen; and the son of Regner came, raging
like a bear, towards Wulnoth; and so at last these two
met, and Wulnoth laughed right joyously&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh! greeting, greeting, Hubba. Long have I
sought thee. Now, greeting!" But Hubba spake not,
but he aimed a mighty blow at Wulnoth's head, and cut
clean through the wing of his helm.</p>

<p>"A good blow, Hubba, a mighty blow," laughed
Wulnoth. "Yet methinks this is better. Dost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>remember the mace which belonged to thy brother,
and how I cut its handle in twain? Look now, Hubba,
and say is this blow as good?"</p>

<p>Now while he spoke, three blows, mighty blows did
Wulnoth turn with his shield; and then he smote, and
men said that never was there such a blow, for neither
shield nor mail could turn it, but the axe sped through
all as if 't were but thin bark; and it fell on Hubba's side
where the shoulder fits the neck, and it cut through bone
and muscle, and the arm fell, and the axe went on and
bit deep into the side; and Hubba fell as the oak falls
before the lightning, fell at the feet of Wulnoth the
Wanderer, while all the Danes cried out in dismay at
what had been done.</p>

<p>But the people of Wessex, they pressed on cheering,
for their hearts were encouraged, and they felt that the
Danes were being defeated; and the fight rolled this
way, and that, now towards the sea, now towards the
land, and great deeds were done, and many a warrior
fell.</p>

<p>But the Danes gave way slowly and stubbornly,
and at last they were beaten, and they turned and fled
back to their ships&mdash;beaten as they had never been
beaten before, save at the field of Ashdune.</p>

<p>And they took the body of Hubba the son of Regner
Lodbrok, and they sang many a death-song for him,
and made lamentations, as for one of the mightiest.
And they buried him in a warrior's grave, with honor,
and with all his weapons; and they raised over him a
heap, and set stones about, and called it after the dead
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>Chieftain&mdash;Hubblestanes&mdash;by which name the place
is still known to men.</p>

<p>And the people of Wessex drove the Danes from
the shore, and took much plunder, and returned to their
homes rejoicing. And Borric the Ealdorman went back
to his stronghold, and he said to Wulnoth&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ye are going back to the King, O Wanderer.
Now tell him that this must not stand as it has done
before. Victory must be added to victory; and I will
send word through all the kingdom, and gather men
everywhere; and when the King is ready, we will march
to meet him, and may God be for us again."</p>

<p>Then Wulnoth parted from Borric; and with his
own company, and the archers, and the band of masterless
men, he set forward to rejoin the King at Athelney.</p>

<p>Now, this is how Wulnoth slew Hubba, and carried
the banner of Regner Lodbrok away to King Alfred.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX<br />

<small><em>Of the Hunting of the Ring</em></small></h2>


<p>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_236.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">N</span>ow, after that Wulnoth and
his companions had set forth
on their journey into Devonshire,
the Danes, who
were led by Guthrun and
Hungwar, began to press on,
spreading over the whole
face of the country, searching
for King Alfred, whom
they were determined to
capture and put to death.</p>

<p>At first, hidden away amidst the marshes of Athelney,
he was fairly safe; but bit by bit the forces drew
nearer and surrounded the whole place; and they who
tarried with the King knew not what to do, for they
liked not to leave their monarch and seek their own
safety, and yet they saw that did they tarry long, so
large a band would be certain to draw the attention of
their foe to their retreat.</p>

<p>More than that, it became increasingly difficult
for them to obtain supplies of food without being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>discovered, and so their hearts sank within them, and
they felt that the battle was lost, and that the cause
of their Lord would fall and the pagan worship of the
Norse gods be established.</p>

<p>And Alfred the King pondered over this, for he
also saw these things, and he knew that his few were
trusty and loyal, and would sooner perish with him than
desert him in his hour of need.</p>

<p>So he called a council of his most wise and devoted
thanes, and to that council came also Osburga his
mother; and there, in the dreary and deserted marshland,
they sat round their fire and talked of what should
best be done.</p>

<p>"The Danes are as the leaves," they said, "and for
one killed many come. Who can deliver us from them?"</p>

<p>Then said Abbot Hugoline, and he spoke in calm
tones, as a man who had faith in that which he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"O thanes, and you our royal Alfred, let us not be
downcast; for if no earthly power can aid us, still God
is able to deliver us from the Danes, as he delivered his
servant Daniel from the lions, and the three Hebrew
children from the raging fiery furnace."</p>

<p>"Thou art right, Abbot," answered the King, "and
while we have him to look to, we will not despair. Now
this is my rede&mdash;Here together we cannot tarry, since
our numbers will betray us, and our foe is too powerful
for us to stand against. We must separate&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay, now nay, O King," they cried. "We will
not leave you."</p>

<p>"Now hear me," answered the King. "If I never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>more might have need of you, I might say tarry here
and let us make an end of our misfortunes and die as
men should. But I do need you&mdash;I shall need you to
fight with me for this our country and for our faith.
For a little while the clouds darken our sky, but presently
the time will come, and we shall need all the aid
we can obtain."</p>

<p>"The Wanderer and his men have deserted us,"
murmured some; but the King answered that Wulnoth
had done what he wished all to do; he had gone
to gather men, and prepare for the time when they
might take the field again.</p>

<p>"This is what ye must all do," he said, "disperse,
and go each his own way; and to all true men give
greeting, and bid them prepare weapons and hide them
away, and be ready to hasten to our standard when the
summons shall come."</p>

<p>"Now the King's word is a wise word," said old
Osburga, and all there listened with reverence to her
words, not only because she was the King's mother, but
because she was wise. "Let his commands be obeyed,
and let us part one from another."</p>

<p>"But, noble lady, what of you and the Queen and
the noble maidens who have shared our trials and wanderings?"
asked Osric. And the King said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Of that I have thought. My mother and my wife,
and the ladies with them, must journey with the Abbot
here to a retreat of which he knows, where they will
be safe. 'T is not far hence; and if need be I can communicate
with them."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>
<p>So, though it grieved the hearts of them all, and
seemed like the giving up of their defence, the Saxons
said that the King's word must be obeyed; and in stern
sorrow they prepared to depart, each with his few followers
going his own way; all save Osric, who tarried
with the King as his companion.</p>

<p>"Now shall we be safer," said the King, "two can
live securely where a score would be in peril. Farewell,
dear friends, and lose not heart nor faith."</p>

<p>So the King embraced his wife, and received his
mother's blessing, and clasped hands with his friends;
and then, when the mists of the evening stole over the
land, they all departed, each taking his own way through
the marshlands, and leaving the King and Osric alone.</p>

<p>And that the King's word was a wise word was
proved; for the next day came bands of Danes, and the
King and Osric were hidden in the marsh, lying in the
mud and covered with the rushes; and they watched
the foe come to the place where they had tarried, and
make search, and give the huts to the fire, and then go
away angry and disappointed; for they had no thought
that the King had taken warning and fled.</p>

<p>And Hungwar and Guthrun were told; and loud
did they curse in their fury, and they ordered that bands
should go in every direction, and search night and day,
giving orders to all the Saxon churls that remained that
if they saw the King they were to seize him and deliver
him up, else otherwise they should be put to the torture,
and their wives and children sold into slavery, and their
roofs given to the flames.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>
<p>Little did Guthrun and his companion know the
stout hearts of the West Saxons; for those very threats
only made the churls sullenly defiant, and determined
that in no case would they betray their King, did they
chance to meet with him.</p>

<p>Moreover, the Saxons learnt that the retreat at
Athelney had been betrayed by a knave; and him they
caught and hanged on a tree, and thus did they pay him
for taking Danish gold and betraying Alfred the King.</p>

<p>Now, for many days did Alfred and Osric wander;
and the King was hunted hither and thither like a beast
of the forest, and often compelled to flee; and his illness
pressed sore upon him, yet his courage was undaunted,
and his faith clear; and often when he lay alone with
Osric in the fens, he would discourse with him concerning
the fleet he was determined to build when the
Danes were conquered and England free again.</p>

<p>"Thou art sure that England shall be free again,
O King?" Osric said. And the King replied, "As certain
as I am that the sun will rise to-morrow."</p>

<p>And thus did the King fare all the days that Wulnoth
was away; and only twice did he manage to see
his wife and mother for a short space; but he heard by
faithful messengers how his companions prospered in
their work, and how all over the land the Saxons were
saying that if the King would only come forth from his
hiding and lead them, they would risk striking another
blow at the foe beneath whose cruel rule the land
groaned.</p>

<p>But the King still tarried for a little, for he wanted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>his friends to gather all they could; and he desired that
the Danes should grow over-confident, thinking that all
opposition was gone, and thus relax their vigilance.</p>

<p>And it chanced that one day Alfred the King came
to a rude hut hidden away in a desolate place, where
dwelt a poor neatherd, alas now with but few cattle to
attend, and those he had to hide away in the middle of
the marshland, else they had surely been stolen by the
enemy.</p>

<p>"Now, Osric, my friend," said Alfred, "I must
to-day receive tidings from Hugoline. Go thou and
glean them, and I will abide here. I will seek shelter
with these good people, and tarry for your return."</p>

<p>"Will they not betray you?" asked Osric, for he
knew of the Danes' words to the peasants. But the King
smiled and answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who would know in this poor way-worn wanderer
the King of Wessex? My very misery makes me
safe, friend. Go, and rest satisfied that I may tarry
here in security."</p>

<p>So Osric went; and Alfred approached the cottage
and knocked with his staff, and then, waiting, he heard
sounds of strife within, and a woman railing at some
one, and he said to himself&mdash;</p>

<p>"We have a shrewish tongue here, a weapon that
the bravest man may well fear."</p>

<p>Then the door opened, and a man looking somewhat
flurried, appeared, and asked what he might want.</p>

<p>"I beg for a shelter and a little food," said the King.
And then a woman appeared, and cried shrilly that they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>had little enough for themselves, and that they had no
wish to bestow that on thriftless wanderers who were
doubtless too lazy to work for their living.</p>

<p>"Turn him away, goodman," she said to her husband.
"Turn him away, and let him taste thy cudgel."</p>

<p>Now the man looked as though he would have liked
to admit the King; and as Alfred was turning to go,
he touched him slyly, and, thrusting his tongue into his
cheek, he said aloud&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, get you gone, rogue. Dost think
that we will harbor such as thou art? Most like thou
hast been serving with the King; and the Danes have
ordered us to give no aid to any such."</p>

<p>And then he received a sounding smack on his
cheek; and his wife, her eyes flashing with anger,
cried&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now out on thee for a nithing! Shall we indeed
be ordered about by the Danes? I would I had them
here, I would trounce them with my besom handle. Art
thou going to turn one of our own countrymen from the
door because the Danes ordered it, forsooth? Thou
hadst better do as a true man should, and hasten to find
the King, and offer him thy service. There, get to thy
work; tending cattle is all thou art fit for; and as for
thee, stranger, come in and tarry; and not all the Danes
in the land shall direct what I am to do."</p>

<p>"'T was the only way to get over her," whispered
the man, with a grin. "Nay, never mind for the clout
I received, I am pretty used to her hand. Well, thou
hast got to stay with her to-day, and not I, and her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>temper is waspish&mdash;the Lord save thee from her tongue,
and grant she may be better tempered when I return
this evening."</p>

<p>So Alfred went in, and the woman snapped out, as if
half repenting of her kindness, that he must make himself
useful and bring her in kindlings.</p>

<p>This Alfred did right willingly; and the woman
having mended her fire, set her rude loaves to bake before
the embers.</p>

<p>"Now you can tarry and watch that they burn not,"
she said, "and turn them as they need it; for I have my
work to think of."</p>

<p>"You may trust them to me, good dame," the King
said. "'T is meet that he who eats of the bread should
aid in its preparing."</p>

<p>Then the woman went out, and the King sat there,
and for a while he thought of the bread; but presently
he began to think of his unhappy kingdom, and of how
the Danes were crushing it, and to ponder upon the
best way to vanquish the foe.</p>

<p>He thought of all the places where battle might be
most advantageously given, and he began, in thought,
to fight his battles, until a strange smell assailed his
nostrils; and he started up to see that the loaves, which
he had so solemnly promised to watch, were all scorched
and blackened.</p>

<p>And then the dame, also smelling the burnt bread,
came running in; and if ever a woman scolded, that
woman did, calling the King lazy, and idle, and good for
nothing, and saying that all men were alike; for whether
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>they be Saxon or Dane, of old time or of new, when
goodwives are angry, they scold and call men good
for nothing.</p>

<p>And the King took it meekly, for indeed he was
sorry that he had broken his word, and yet he could
not tell her how it chanced. Indeed he felt that even if
he could have done that, it would have been no excuse;
for having given his word, he ought to have kept it, and
not have suffered his thoughts to wander.</p>

<p>And the woman in her anger seized her stick and
struck the King; and just at that moment the door
opened, and in came Wulnoth and Osric; for Osric had
met Wulnoth as he returned, and the Wanderer was
searching for the King; and together they had come on.</p>

<p>And Wulnoth gave a cry of surprise, and grabbed
hold of the woman, who turned her anger on him, crying
out that she knew they were all robbers, but that some
of them should have broken heads ere they robbed her.</p>

<p>"Tush, woman, no robbers we," said Wulnoth, as
he grabbed her hands, for she had scratched his face
with her nails. "Come, dame, what woman art thou to
strike thy King?"</p>

<p>"The King!" cried the woman in dismay; and
then she fell on her knees and cried for pardon; ending
by saying that, King or not, he had no right to let
her bread burn when he had promised to mind it.</p>

<p>"That for the bread," began Wulnoth, but the
King stopped him&mdash;</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, Wanderer, 't is I who am to blame, and
I deserved all the scolding which I have received.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>Dame, I crave your pardon; rise and look not so dismayed;
and if ever the sun shines in this poor land
again, thou shalt not be sorry for having let the King
sit by thy hearth, even if he has spoilt thy loaves."</p>

<p>Then did the King turn to Wulnoth and ask him
where he had been, and what had been his fortune,
and what it was he carried. And Wulnoth laughed and
answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"A present for thee, O King. Say how thou dost
like it," and he unrolled the great raven banner which
he had captured, and told the King of how the Danes
were routed, and how Borric was busy gathering all
the men of Devon to come to his aid.</p>

<p>And Osric had good tidings also, that they of
Somerset and Dorset and Hampshire (that is how we
call the places now&mdash;of course in those days the names
were different) were all ready to come when he summoned
them; and all were eager to have another cast
at their foe, and to strike for freedom and the Lord's
faith.</p>

<p>And then did Alfred the King kneel down and the
tears ran down his cheeks, and he thanked God for His
goodness and mercy, and offered praise to Him for
His greatness and majesty.</p>

<p>And Wulnoth looked and listened; and then a
great feeling came to him that the King's God was the
true God, and that the Lord Christ was the real Lord,
and that he was a sinner who needed the pardon of
which he had heard; and he knelt down, he who had
knelt to no God before, and he said&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>
<p>"O King, I seem to see dimly, as one who looks
at the sun. I have found the mightiest and greatest,
and he is the White Christ, and Him will I love and
serve, and be his man."</p>

<p>And the King looked up and smiled, and he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now truly do I rejoice, Wanderer. I have found
hope anew, and courage; and shall perchance find my
crown and kingdom; but thou hast found a better
thing&mdash;a crown and a kingdom that shall forever
endure."</p>

<p>Now, this is how the King wandered as an outcast,
and this is how the loaves were burnt, and this is how
Wulnoth brought the banner to the King, and how he
found the mightiest and the bravest of all.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI<br />

<small><em>Of the Gleeman who visited the Danish
Camp</em></small></h2>


<p>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_247.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">N</span>ow, when the King left the
neatherd's cottage he went
back with Osric and Wulnoth
to his old hiding-place
at Athelney, for this was
safe now, seeing that the
Danes, having searched
there, and having burnt the
huts, were not likely to
visit it again.</p>

<p>And here the three tarried, and talked of all that
had happened, and received messages from one thane
and another, telling of the number of men which he
could bring.</p>

<p>And urgent were the prayers sent to Alfred that
he would at once put himself at the head of the forces
and give battle to the foe. But to these prayers the
King replied that they must remain patient a little
longer.</p>

<p>"O King, why dost thou delay?" cried Osric in
wonder. "Did I not know thy hero soul, I should think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>'t was because thou wast afraid." And at that saying
the King smiled, and made reply.</p>

<p>"And didst thou say so, O Osric, thou wouldst
be telling but the simple truth," he said. And Osric
stared and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Read me thy rede, O King, for of a truth I cannot
understand thy meaning; only this I know, that fear
and Alfred were ever strangers."</p>

<p>"Yet I fear, my friend," the King answered, "for
of a truth this cast has all our fortunes thrown with
it; and if we fail now, we fail for good; therefore I
fear to make the attempt before being certain of how
best to succeed."</p>

<p>"A quick blow and a bold one, is ever my way,"
said Wulnoth. And the King shook his head.</p>

<p>"A good way, Wanderer, provided that thou knowest
where to hit; otherwise thou mayest but smite the
air, and be smitten thyself in turn, ere thou canst draw
back for defence."</p>

<p>"What is thy counsel, O King?" asked Osric, "for
what thou dost rede, that is certain to have wisdom
in it."</p>

<p>"Now, Osric," answered the King, "but now thou
didst say that didst thou not know me, thou wouldst
have thought me a nithing; I say that did I not know
thee, I should deem thee but a flatterer. Yet so far as
my wisdom goes, thou shalt have it. These Danes
have tarried here long, but here they will not surely
stop, seeing that it is but a barren spot and they think
that I have left it. Now, 't is my wish to find out, if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>possible, whither they intend to journey, or whether
they will still remain nigh the place; then shall we
know best where to collect our forces, and when to strike
the hardest and the surest."</p>

<p>"But how can this information be obtained, O
King? Dost thou know any of their number whom thou
canst buy?"</p>

<p>"Nay," answered King Alfred, "I know none, and
if I did, I would not make the attempt to bargain with
them; for I hold it a disgraceful thing to try to make
a man turn traitor; or to have dealings with one vile
enough to be one. Moreover, to deal with such a one
is dangerous; for the man who will betray his chief
may well be expected to betray those who trust him."</p>

<p>"A wise word, King; but still, if we deal not with
a traitor, I see no way of obtaining the knowledge
which we desire."</p>

<p>"I have a way, O my friend, if it may be put into
practice; and methinks it can. Rest but a short time,
and I will put it to the test."</p>

<p>So spake the King, and with that the two warriors
were contented, for they knew that Alfred never used
vain or empty words; and so they waited patiently,
until it should please him to take them into his confidence.</p>

<p>Now as they sat at the fire talking, they heard
the sound of a harp; and looking up, they beheld a
wandering gleeman standing before them with a poor
and broken harp; and he struck the chords and sang,
and his voice was faint and weak; yet he sang a good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>song of England in the days when the Danes had not
come to it, and he sang of the good days that should
come, when once again the land should be free; and
Osric said when the song was done&mdash;</p>

<p>"A good song, friend, and well sung; yet methinks
thou must be foolish to come and sing to us who are
here, when we cannot reward you with even a meal
such as a man might not be ashamed to offer to
another."</p>

<p>"I sing to those whom I sing to," said the gleeman.
"Shall I sing you another song?" and Wulnoth
nodded&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ay, for even a song may drive away gloom,
friend," he said. "Sing, if thou wilt sing without hope
of reward."</p>

<p>"Nay, then I cannot sing, for I look for great
reward," was the answer he received. "But I know
that I shall obtain that reward, so now listen to my
song."</p>

<p>Then he struck the harp again, and he sang, and
Wulnoth opened his mouth in surprise, for the song
was of him, and his love for Edgiva, and his finding of
the Lord; and the Wanderer started up when the music
ceased, and he cried&mdash;</p>

<p>"By that Lord Whom thou hast said that I serve,
thou knowest far too much, my friend; for there are
but two who knew of this, and one is by my side."</p>

<p>"And the other stands before thee, Wanderer,"
came the voice of the King. And at that the two started
up bewildered&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>
<p>"Alfred!" they cried. And the gleeman answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"Even so, my friends. Now, you two tarry here,
for I am content. If ye, who know me well, fail to
recognize me, there is little fear that my foes will do
so."</p>

<p>"But where goest thou, O King?" they asked.
And he answered that he was going to the camp of the
Danes. But at that the two looked grave, for of a truth
the danger was great, and did the King fail in deceiving
the foe, there would be no more mercy for him than
there had been for Edmund of East Anglia.</p>

<p>But the King laughed away their fears, and made
them promise to abide where they were.</p>

<p>"If messengers come," he said, "receive the messages,
and bid them go back and prepare, and within
two weeks shall word come to them. Then, when once
the word comes, they must hasten. They must move
so swiftly that the grass bends not beneath their feet;
for then will it be that we must strike a swift blow at
the very heart of our foe."</p>

<p>"You feel that you must do this thing, O King?"
asked Osric, and the King made answer that it must
be done.</p>

<p>"By now will they have heard of the destruction
of their fleet," he said, "and that of itself must needs
make them come to some speedy decision; and what
the decision is, I must find out."</p>

<p>So they had no more words to say, feeling that
much was at stake; and Alfred, taking his harp, went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>away and set face boldly towards the camp of the
Danes.</p>

<p>And when he got nigh, he struck his harp and began
to sing, and he sang the song of the bear jarl, whose
son was Beorn, and the vikings gathered round him,
for they loved the gleeman's songs.</p>

<p>And Alfred noticed all that could be seen, and how
the camp was far more badly kept than it should have
been; for these Danes were so confident now, that they
forgot their caution; and he sang again and again, and
presently a messenger came from Guthrun, asking who
it was that made music in the camp.</p>

<p>Then when the chief was told, he commanded that
the gleeman be brought before him, and made to sing
against his singers; and Alfred was taken to the hall
where the holdas sat.</p>

<p>There was Guthrun, as hearty as ever, and there
was Hungwar, and he looked fiercer and wilder than
of yore; and Guthrun cried to the disguised King.</p>

<p>"How now, Saxon, dost value thy life so little, that
thou dost come hither?"</p>

<p>Then Alfred answered, speaking in the tones of an
old man&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, chief, that is a poor saying; for of a truth
a gleeman knows no country or race, but sings of the
brave wherever he finds them. Moreover, it is but
natural that I should come."</p>

<p>"And wherefore?" demanded the chief.</p>

<p>"First, because I have heard of thy Danish gleemen,
and I wish to hear their cunning playing; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>secondly, because, Saxon or Dane, men must eat; and
since thou hast left us little, to whom but thee can we
come for food?"</p>

<p>Then did the Danes laugh loud and long, for it
pleased them to hear this of their doings, seeing that
if there was no food in the land, the people must soon
be starved into submission, and Alfred would not be
able to muster any more men; and so they bade the
henchmen give the harper food, and after that they set
him to play against their own men.</p>

<p>But Alfred was cunning; and though he was a
musician far beyond the best of the Danes, he let them
play the best, lest he make them envious and so be
dismissed.</p>

<p>And that also pleased the holdas; and presently
Hungwar bent forward to him, and cried fiercely&mdash;</p>

<p>"Little canst thou play, old man. Thou art not fit
to be called a gleeman beside the singers of Denmark.
Now see if thou canst sing a song of Regner Lodbrok;
and if thou canst not, then by Thor thou shalt sing
thine own death-song."</p>

<p>"That is a hard saying to hearten a man for his
work, chief," answered the gleeman, "yet I will try
my best."</p>

<p>Then he struck his harp afresh, and he sang the
song of Regner Lodbrok and his slaying of the dragon;
and he sang so well that all applauded him, and some
pulled their massive bracelets off and cast them to
him for his reward; and Hungwar himself said that
the gleeman might stay in the camp and sing to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>soldiers, seeing that they had little to occupy their time
while they were waiting for news from the laggards
who had sailed with the fleet.</p>

<p>Now that told Alfred that the tidings of the defeat
had not yet arrived, and he was the more anxious to
stay there; for he desired to learn what the chiefs
would do when they heard the news.</p>

<p>And into the camp he went with the vikings; and
not one there even dreamed that beneath the ragged
clothes and feeble form the King of Wessex was hidden.
And Alfred saw the whole camp, and heard the talk
of the vikings; and sometimes he sat in the lower part
of the hall while the soldiers feasted, and he heard the
chiefs talking of their plans.</p>

<p>And the fourth day while he thus sat, there came
a horseman, all spent with his journey and covered
with dust; and when he entered the hall, he cried
aloud, without even giving greeting&mdash;</p>

<p>"Evil tidings, chiefs, are mine to tell. Evil and
black tidings. The fleet is destroyed, and the warriors
are slain, and the banner of Regner Lodbrok is
taken."</p>

<p>Then a great hush fell on all there; and men looked
from one to another in dismay; for worse to them than
the loss of the fleet, was the loss of the banner, which
they supposed had been blest by the gods, and which
always led them to victory.</p>

<p>And then did Hungwar start up and cry aloud&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now evil was it that I suffered the banner to go
with Hubba my brother; and if he recover it not again,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>then we twain will have a word to say and a deed to
do together when we meet."</p>

<p>"Speak no evil of Hubba," answered the messenger.
"For him the death-song has been sung; and
he died as a hero should die; and also Biorn Ironside
has gone to the storm-land with him."</p>

<p>"Hubba dead and Biorn dead," said Guthrun.
"Now truly thy tidings are heavy."</p>

<p>"Think not of them. Not of the dead, but of the
banner, must we think," cried Hungwar fiercely.
"Blood, and much blood, must flow for this. Who led
the foe, man? Not this King of Wessex, whom we
have hunted for, and who has disappeared as though
the earth had swallowed him?"</p>

<p>"Two jarls led the foe," the man answered, "and
mighty warriors both. One Borric, an Ealdorman of
the south&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Borric shall die," cried Hungwar. "Who the
other?"</p>

<p>"A mighty man whom men call the Wanderer.
He who once was in thy service. He struck down thy
brother, and he took the banner away."</p>

<p>Then did Hungwar turn pale for the moment, for
he thought that this was the work of the evil spirits
helping Wulnoth; and he cried madly, gnashing his
teeth, and clenching his fists&mdash;</p>

<p>"Evil, evil, upon him, and evil the day when I
saw him before me and suffered him to live. Guthrun,
we must march. We must pursue this man, and take
the banner back. Not a girl in Denmark but would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>scorn us for nithings, did we return without it, and
without having avenged the slight done to it."</p>

<p>"In that I am with thee, Hungwar," replied Guthrun.
"But march whither? We must know where
the man is before we can pursue him."</p>

<p>"I will burn down every dwelling, I will slay
every living soul, till I find him," answered Hungwar;
"and for this Wanderer, no jarl he, but a thrall; and
when I catch him, he shall die the most terrible death
that I can think of."</p>

<p>"Now, not so," said Guthrun firmly. "Thou art
angry, Hungwar, and no wonder, and for that reason
thou speakest thus. Be the man jarl or thrall, he is a
hero and a warrior, and must be treated as such. A hero,
be he of the foe even, deserves a hero's death."</p>

<p>"Wait thou and see," answered Hungwar fiercely.
"Oh! I would that I might have him face to face alone!
I would repay all then."</p>

<p>"We must send messengers and recall all the
bands," Guthrun said. "We must foray, and secure
plenty of provisions. For a week or a fortnight we must
tarry here, and make preparations; and then we will
advance, and put the matter to the test, and everywhere
proclaim that until the banner of Regner is delivered
to us again, we will harry the country far and
wide."</p>

<p>At this all the vikings shouted; and drawing their
swords waved them in the air. Yet the spirits of the
Danes were cast down, and they were as men bewildered;
and Guthrun himself, when he was alone,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>sat with clouded brow, and pondered, and his thoughts
were strange thoughts&mdash;</p>

<p>For Guthrun had heard the story of the White
Christ; and now he wondered, seeing that Odin's Raven
was captured, and Odin had not smitten the men who
had carried it away, whether, after all, the Saxon God
was not stronger than the gods of the Northland.</p>

<p>Guthrun had not forgotten the slaying of Edmund
the King, and the thoughts which that brought to him
often troubled him. Presently Guthrun was to do as
Wulnoth had done, and acknowledge that the Lord was
of all lords the chief.</p>

<p>And that night the Saxon gleeman was missing
from the camp of the Danes; and when none could find
him, the rumor went abroad that he had been no gleeman,
but a spy amongst them; and that did but trouble
them the more.</p>

<p>And not long afterwards Alfred the King was back
with Wulnoth and Osric, and to them he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now has the time come, my friends, and the foe
are dismayed by reason of the loss of their ships!
Hasten, both, and send others on; and through the land
let the summons go that all who love me, and would
strike for freedom, shall hasten hither without delay.
Hasten, for all now depends upon our being ready to
smite our enemy ere they have time to decide what they
will do."</p>

<p>Now, this is how King Alfred spied out the Danish
camp, and how he sent Wulnoth and Osric to summon
his forces to his aid.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII<br />

<small><em>The Battle of Ethandune</em></small></h2>


<p>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_258.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">F</span>ast and hard did Wulnoth
and Osric ride on the King's
bidding; and as they went,
they sent other trusty messengers
on in different directions;
and ere long the
people began to come, every
man with his weapons, and
most of them warriors hardened
in many a hard-fought
battle; and all hailed the King with joy, and looked
forward eagerly to meeting their foes on the field of
slaughter once more.</p>

<p>And there came Abbot Hugoline&mdash;for Bishop
Eadred had gone north to seek to bring the men of
Mercia and those of Northumbria to combine with
Wessex.</p>

<p>And each day did they in the King's camp gather,
and unite in praying to God for victory; while the King
proclaimed that only those who were good men and
true, and faithful to the Church, should remain; for he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>said that 't were better to fight with a few upon whom
they might look for God's blessing, than with many
who could only expect His anger.</p>

<p>And the first care of the King was to make entrenchments
great and strong around his old camping
ground at Athelney; for to this spot he saw he would
have to retreat did the fortune of war go against him;
and this time it would have to be with all his force,
since if once the army disbanded, it would be gathered
no more.</p>

<p>Here, too, he gathered great store of food and
weapons, and gave the command to one of his thanes
and to a small body of hardened warriors. "This
stronghold must be kept at all costs," he said, "for not
only will it be our retreat in case of need, but while it
is held, the Danes will fear to move far. They know
not how many or how few are here. If they come
against it, then will I and the army fall upon them
from their rear; and if they abide and await us, then
can those here sally out and help us when we meet them
in the field."</p>

<p>Longer did it take the King than he had thought,
to complete this work; yet, as if to aid him, the Danes
still remained in their camp, for they were uncertain,
and their counsels were divided.</p>

<p>Then, Athelney being strengthened, King Alfred,
with whom now were all the men of Somerset, marched
northward and encamped at Egbert's Stone, which was
on the borders of Selwood Forest, which they of Wales
called <i lang="owl" xml:lang="owl">coit mawr</i>, or the great forest. And here with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>great rejoicing, and with prayer, the King's banner was
once more unfurled; and once more he found himself
at the head of a force which was equal to that of their
cruel foe; while each day more men came hastening
to join him; and all over the Westland the tidings
flew, and men threw aside their work, and seized their
war gear, and refeathered their arrows, and set out to
go to the King's aid.</p>

<p>And all old quarrels were forgotten; and they
who had been foes became friends, and each stood for
all, and all for each, as Englishmen should; and the
King saw that the cause which had weakened the English
in the past was now removed, and his heart beat
high with hope and joy.</p>

<p>Then, when all the forces were collected, for two
days did the King tarry at Egbert's Stone, and made
preparation for the march and the fight; and hither
came the Queen and Osburga; and with them Edgiva
the Beautiful, so that for a brief space Wulnoth was
with his love again.</p>

<p>And he took her little hands in his strong palms,
and he gazed into her beautiful face, and told her how
he also had found the White Christ, and how he understood
Wyborga's thorn-crowned cross at last.</p>

<p>"Not yet has the Abbot baptized me," he said,
"but when this fight is over, that will be done; and
then, my Princess, the King having his crown secure,
must I set forth on my wanderings once more, and seek
for thy noble brother, my friend and Prince."</p>

<p>And to that Edgiva answered gently&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>
<p>"The Lord guide thee, my Wulnoth, as He has
guided thee to the light, and when thy task is over,
then be sure that be thou thrall or be thou thane,
Edgiva will give thee thy reward, and be joyful in the
doing of it."</p>

<p>Little time was there for love speaking now, for
all was hurry; and the royal ladies having retired with
their train, the King gave orders on the morning of
the third day, and the army marched eastward, and
encamped that night on a lofty hill, from the slopes
of which they could see afar the camp of the Danes.</p>

<p>For Guthrun and Hungwar, alarmed at the tidings
they received of how the King of the West Saxons was
advancing against them with a host, had hastily broken
their old camp and advanced to meet him, travelling
swiftly so that they might be beyond the reach of those
left at Athelney; and now they were encamped in a
strong place, with earthworks thrown up, to which they
might retire if the fight went against them, and there
hold out till more came to rescue them.</p>

<p>So the night through, the forces remained; and
in the Danish camp was heard the sound of wild revelry,
but in the Saxon army the voice of prayer; and in the
morning the King advanced to a place called Ethandune,
and there the Danes came to meet him, now, alas! with
no raven banner floating over them.</p>

<p>Woe, woe, for the Danes! Woe for the daughters
of Regner Lodbrok who had woven that banner in
a single night! Woe to the sons of the Northland, for
great was to be the slaughter that day.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>
<p>And the King drew up his army in battle array,
and he sat his steed, and spoke to them, and urged them
to be of good courage and each one play a man's part.</p>

<p>"My dear subjects and fellow countrymen," he
said, "this day is a day big with fate, and England calls
to each of her sons to be a hero. Yonder are the Black
Strangers who would trample out the church of the
Lord, and put the priests and the holy maidens to shame
and death. Yonder are the murderers of little children
and gray-heads, yonder the spoilers of your homes.
Is it not said that they who slay with the sword shall
by the sword be slain? Ye are as the arm of the Lord
this day. Up and smite them, and may His blessing
be on our fair England, on this day of battle."</p>

<p>Then did the battle begin; and the Saxon archers
stood forward, and shot thick and fast, and their bows
were like the bow of Einar Tamberskelver who fought
with King Olaf in his last fight, and their arrows like
the bite of serpents, so that the Danes fell fast, and cried
to their leaders to hasten forward, that they might
get at the Saxons with sword and axe.</p>

<p>And then, as the Danes began to charge, the archers
stepped back, and the spears of the champions were
hurled, and the Danes were smitten again, for the
Saxons could cast as well as they could shoot, and there
were men of the Britons with the King also, who could
cast right hand or left.</p>

<p>Thus it was that ere the Black Strangers reached
the King's lines, the death-song had been sung for
many a viking warrior; for there were thoughts of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>wrongs received, and vengeance desired, which made
the Saxon arm strong, and sent the spears like the
lightning stroke, piercing armor and shields.</p>

<p>And then the war game and the man's game began
in good earnest, and the King cried to his army to go
forward down the slope on which they stood, and meet
the charge; and the war-horns sounded, and the English
war-cry rolled to the air, affrighting even the eagles
who came to the slaughter; and rank met rank, and
the thirsty land drank deep its fill of red blood.</p>

<p>Now Guthrun had taken the old Danish plan of
forming his men wedge-shaped, and seeking to drive
them into the heart of the Saxon ranks, and to cast them
into disorder. But Wulnoth knew of that plan, for he
had so fought himself in the old days; and he had
spoken to the King of a way to thwart it, and turn it
to account&mdash;and thus did he and Osric, one on either
side.</p>

<p>Each had a chosen band, and each formed his
men into the wedge, and at the point of either wedge
was Osric and Wulnoth, one at each. They stood back
hidden by the host, until Guthrun's warriors made their
attack, and then they thundered out one on either side,
and they smote the Danish wedge, and pierced it through
and through, and broke the ranks and scattered the
warriors, and gave them as prey to the sword and the
axe; and there was no mercy asked, and no mercy
given, for Dane and Saxon were alike minded to make
an end of the matter.</p>

<p>Woe for the Danes that day, for many of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>mightiest leaders were slain, and sore Guthrun longed
for the strong Hubba and the wise Ironbeard, and for
Halfdane the Fierce, who had gone northward.</p>

<p>Yet heroes were the holdas, and valiant deeds did
they do; and many a good Saxon fell, and his bones
are still far beneath the green fields which now grow
o'er that field of slaughter.</p>

<p>Here raged Hungwar like a berserker, and ever
towards him did Wulnoth strive, and ever did it seem
as if some invisible power kept them sundered.</p>

<p>And there fought Guthrun, his eyes flashing, his
teeth gnashing, wielding his man-feller, a great iron
mace fully twenty pounds' weight, beneath whose blows
the stoutest helm cracked like a nutshell, and the
strongest fell as the ox falls in the shambles.</p>

<p>And there, too, was a young holda, Hastings by
name, who in after years spread fire and sword through
the land; and grim old Harold Blackfang, and Forkbeard
the One-eyed, and many a mighty one who played
the man's game with fierce joy, and piled the slain
high along his path.</p>

<p>But the Saxons were mighty also, and the King
was where the battle was thickest, and with him Osric,
and Ethelred, and Borric, and Abbot Hugoline clad
in war gear and doing his part like a man and hero;
and with them many a noble thane, and many a sethcundman;
and each did mighty deeds that day, and
made the sword sing a good song, and drove the vikings
before them like sheep.</p>

<p>For the Danes had grown over-confident, and had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>given their time to the wine horn, and had neglected
their war tools in peace time; and now, instead of
shrieking women and fleeing churls, they had men
burning with the memories of many wrongs endured,
and determined to wipe the stain of the invader from
English ground.</p>

<p>Backward and forward did the fight sway, and
none would yield; and the leaders called to encourage
their men, and plunged into the peril heedlessly; and
so, for two long hours did the war game go, and then,
sullenly but surely, the Danes were driven back, and
the Saxons pressed on with shouts of victory, while
thousands lay there gasping their life away, or still
in the death-sleep.</p>

<p>And now again did Wulnoth rage like a lion; and
he shouted to Hungwar to stay and meet him face
to face; but Hungwar only glared at him, and slew
those near, showing his teeth like an old she-bear when
she stands over her cub.</p>

<p>"Press on, press on," cried the King. "The victory
is ours. One more good stroke, a strong stroke, and
they flee. Press on, my men, for our dear Lord, and for
England."</p>

<p>Then, led by the King himself, and by Hugoline,
the Saxons charged, and the Danes broke and fled,
though Guthrun cried aloud and beat his breast in his
grief; and though Hungwar smote down his own men,
when they turned their backs to the foe.</p>

<p>But there was no staying them, for their hearts
were gone, and they said that now the Raven Banner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>was gone, Odin fought for them no more; and so,
pursued by the victorious Saxons, they, who had never
fled, now ran like the flock before the sheep-dogs;
and the leaders and the holdas were borne along with
them, grief torturing their hearts, and shame on their
faces; and thus they were chased even to their very
camp; and then King Alfred gave the signal and
ordered the pursuit to cease, for he saw that there was
danger, and that the soldiers might fall into a trap
did they go on.</p>

<p>And outside the camp Wulnoth stood, his axe on
his shoulder, all jagged and notched, and covered with
a dreadful hue; and he cried aloud to the fleeing Danes,
and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ho! sons of Odin, why flee ye so swiftly? Tell
ye that one desires to speak with the son of Regner.
Long this day have I sought him, yet with no avail;
and now I would meet him and give him greeting, and
send him on that journey on which I have sent his
brother, Hubba."</p>

<p>So he shouted, and the vikings hung their heads,
and muttered that it was shame that the son of Regner
did not go out and meet this champion; but Hungwar
heeded not, and only said that he could wound
Wulnoth more surely in another way.</p>

<p>And on the steep mounds he stood, and answered,
and called Wulnoth the shameless son of a thrall.</p>

<p>"See, thou Wanderer, what a dainty prize I have
here!" he cried. "I sold the brother into slavery;
and the sister shall be my maiden now." And then,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>to Wulnoth's dismayed eyes, there appeared Edgiva,
held by two rude vikings.</p>

<p>He uttered a loud cry of dismay and rage, and
would have started forward; but Edgiva held out her
hands and called to him, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Fear nothing, Wulnoth, my love. The Lord
Who has given victory to the King, will preserve me.
Go back now and tell the King that the Queen and
the noble Osburga are safe, and Wyborga is unharmed.
Only I was taken, for I was hastening to the field of
slaughter, to see if I might be of service in tending
the wounded; and I fell in with a band of the enemy,
who seized me and brought me hither. Yet Guthrun
will not let this man slay me."</p>

<p>"How will Guthrun prevent me?" roared Hungwar
fiercely. And to that Guthrun himself answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"I will prevent thee with my life; for of a truth
this is but a nithing thing to do. There shall no harm
come to the lady." Then he added in low tones,
"Thou fool, seest thou not that if we do this wrong,
nothing can save our lives? and if I must die, it shall
not be with this nithing thing against my name!"</p>

<p>And then Wulnoth spoke again and he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hearken to me, Guthrun, you who once called
me a true man; and you, all ye vikings and holdas
of Denmark. 'T is true I am a thrall, in so far as
my father was called thrall by the false son of noble
Cerdic. But of Cerdic's blood am I also; and that is
as high as the blood of Regner Lodbrok. Now, this
is my word. Alfred the King of Wessex has told me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>how Hungwar boasted that he wished he could meet
me face to face, we two alone; for Alfred was that
Saxon gleeman, O Guthrun."</p>

<p>"By my beard, 't is good for him we knew it not,
or he would not have beaten us to-day, Wanderer,"
replied Guthrun. "But go on, say thou what thou hast
to say."</p>

<p>"This I say then," Wulnoth continued. "Hungwar
desired to see me; and, moreover, he has many
debts to pay to me. That scar on his face I put there,
I a boy, and with only a broken sword, when he was
clad in war-gear and fully armed. Ay, and I had surely
made an end of him then, had not the viking Wahrmund
struck me down. I have taken his father's
banner, I have slain his brother Hubba, surely he owes
me a debt&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He does, indeed," cried the vikings who listened.</p>

<p>"And I will give him chance of paying me in
full," Wulnoth said. "To-morrow I will come and meet
him, he and I alone; and some from your camp and some
from ours shall abide, to witness the fight. If he make
an end of me, well&mdash;then must Edgiva mourn; but
if I make an end of him, then my word is, let the maid
be delivered up to me as my prize, for mine she is,
and none but a nithing would have stolen her."</p>

<p>"Now," cried Guthrun, "this must be, Hungwar.
Thou hast heard his speech, and if thou dost
refuse, not a warrior but will call thee nithing, and thy
own people will cast thee out. Surely the thing must
be, Hungwar."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>
<p>"The thing must be!" cried the vikings, and
Hungwar glared and laughed. "I ask nothing better,"
he said. "To-morrow, boaster, I will slay thee."</p>

<p>"To-morrow we will see who has been boasting,"
answered Wulnoth. "Guthrun, thou art noble of heart,
though thou art our foe. To thee I trust Edgiva my
beloved."</p>

<p>"She shall suffer no harm while I live," answered
Guthrun; and Wulnoth waved his hand and departed,
and went back to tell the King how Edgiva was held
prisoner. And Guthrun took Edgiva and gave her into
charge of his wife, and set a guard at the door of her
tent, and so kept he his word to Wulnoth.</p>

<p>Now, this is how the host of the Danes were defeated
at Ethandune, and how the field of slaughter
was left to the Saxons, and this is how Edgiva was
seen by Wulnoth in the Danish camp, and how Wulnoth
challenged Hungwar to holmgang with him, and
Guthrun promised to protect Edgiva the Beautiful.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII<br />

<small><em>How Hungwar was slain, and the
Danes became Christians</em></small></h2>


<p>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_270.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">N</span>ow, on the morning following
the battle, Wulnoth
rose and donned his war
gear, and took his shield
and his axe; and he girded
on the great sword which
he had found amongst the
ashes in ruined Lethra, and
set forth for the Danish
camp; and with him went
the King, and many a thane, and a great following of
the soldiers.</p>

<p>And to meet them came Guthrun and his holdas,
and the Danish vikings; and a truce was proclaimed,
and death pronounced upon any man of either camp
who drew sword or made brawl that day.</p>

<p>And with Guthrun was brought Edgiva the Beautiful,
guarded by the vikings, and as the prisoner of
Hungwar the son of Regner Lodbrok.</p>

<p>And Guthrun greeted the King as one brave soldier
should greet another, and he said&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>
<p>"O King, thou who wast brave enough to come
alone to my camp, had I found thee then, surely I
had slain thee; but if thou come to-day, thou shalt be
my guest, and with my own life will I defend thee."</p>

<p>And Alfred answered him with courteous words,
and said that could they only be at peace, they might
be good friends, and feast together often.</p>

<p>Then did Osric stand forward, and make proclamation,
and say that Wulnoth the Wanderer declared
Hungwar the son of Regner Lodbrok to be nithing and
coward, and slayer of bound men, and torturer of
women and children, and that he challenged him to
battle alone, with none to help either. And this was
to be the condition of the fight&mdash;that if Hungwar
conquered Wulnoth, then he should have his life to
keep or to take as he chose, and he should receive again
the Raven Banner, and Edgiva should be his to sell or
to keep. But if Wulnoth conquered, then Edgiva should
be given back to freedom to do as she list, and Hungwar's
life should belong to Wulnoth.</p>

<p>And the Danes and Saxons said ay to this, and
swore to observe the conditions; and then all men
drew back, and looked on breathlessly, and the two
champions in their armor, and holding shield and axe,
advanced and stood alone. And Wulnoth said&mdash;</p>

<p>"At last, Hungwar! At last we meet, and I have
lived for this, these many years."</p>

<p>"And thou wilt rue it forever after," was the grim
answer. "With this axe will I slay thee."</p>

<p>"Seest thou this sword, Hungwar?" laughed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>Wulnoth. "I picked it from the ruins of Lethra, and I
have kept it for this day. It has wearied waiting for
a song to sing, and thou canst guess what song that
will be, and whose it will be. So now let us make an
end of the matter, for speech is for women, and deeds
are for men."</p>

<p>So they drew near, and all there wondered how this
fight would go. For though Hungwar was older than
Wulnoth, he had the strength of ten; and his great
muscles stood up in masses upon his arms, and with his
grizzled hair and flowing beard and moustache, he
looked like Thor himself in his might.</p>

<p>And from his parted lips his teeth showed yellow
and black, like fangs; and his bloodshot eyes rolled
angrily; yet deep in his heart was there a black fear,
for he dreaded Wulnoth more than a score of champions.</p>

<p>And the Wanderer looked strong and mighty, and
his face was full of joy light; for was he not fighting
for the freedom of his Princess, and now avenging the
wrongs done to her brother, and her father, and his
own father and mother?</p>

<p>"Art ready, Hungwar?" he asked, and Hungwar
growled, "I am weary of waiting," and smote at him
a mighty blow, that seemed as if nought could turn
it aside.</p>

<p>But Wulnoth caught it on his shield; and then
he struck in turn, and Hungwar caught his blow and
was unharmed.</p>

<p>Then like circles of light did the axes swing and
play, and the blows fell fast, and the shields groaned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>and shivered; and at last Hungwar's split in twain,
though it was of stoutest oak, and lined with triple
leather, and studded with massive bosses.</p>

<p>And when Wulnoth saw that, he swung his axe
upwards with all his might, and cut clean through the
handle of Hungwar's weapon, as he had cut through
the handle of his mace in the long past; and then
he cast aside his own axe and shield, and drew the great
sword with the blue-veined steel blade; and he laughed
aloud, though his breath came in deep gasps, so hard
had he labored.</p>

<p>"Now, Hungwar, now we have finished this child's
play with shield and axe; now draw thy sword and
let us have a good song."</p>

<p>But Hungwar never answered; only he looked
into Wulnoth's face with eyes of hate, which were yet
eyes of fear; for he who had never feared death, now
feared, not the dying, but the man by whom death was
to come.</p>

<p>"The maiden will be freed," said the vikings to
each other. "There is a shadow on the spirit of Hungwar,
and the Valkyres tarry for him."</p>

<p>And Hungwar drew his sword and advanced, and
now it was a man's game, indeed; for Hungwar's shield
was broken, and Wulnoth had cast his aside, and the
great blades must be sword and shield alike.</p>

<p>They clashed together, and the sparks flew as from
a smith's anvil; and each champion strove, his eye fixed
on his foe; and each knew that death was near.</p>

<p>"By Thor!" growled Guthrun, "'t is a mighty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>fight, and one that it does a man good to see. They
are champions both." And to that a holda said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ay, for Hungwar is fighting for life, and Wulnoth
is fighting for love; and methinks that love will win."</p>

<p>And presently Hungwar's sword was smitten from
his hand, and all looked for Wulnoth to make an end.
But he cast aside his own sword, and with his bare
hands he gripped his foe; and they two strained and
swayed in their efforts; and Hungwar grinned in rage
to think that Wulnoth was putting him to shame by
thus refusing to take advantage of him; and in their
struggling the berserker rage came upon him, and he
bent forward and gashed Wulnoth's cheek with his
fangs, crying&mdash;</p>

<p>"A mark for a mark, Wanderer."</p>

<p>"And a dog's death for a mad dog who bites,"
cried Wulnoth angrily; and he put out all his strength,&mdash;the
strength which Osth the giant had taught him&mdash;and
he squeezed and squeezed, and Hungwar gasped,
and smote blindly with his fists, and his lips parted, and
the foam came from them, and it was tinged with
blood.</p>

<p>And Wulnoth squeezed yet harder, and the muscles
gave, and the great bones yielded, and the ribs snapped;
and Hungwar gave a gasp and became limp, so that
Wulnoth cast him helpless to the earth, and knelt beside
him.</p>

<p>"There, son of Regner!" he cried. "I have beaten
thee with but my bare hands. Now dost thou yield
to me and sue for life?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>
<p>"Thus do I yield," answered Hungwar; and he
raised himself and he plucked a knife from his girdle
where he had hidden it, though they had agreed that
they would wear no daggers, and he struck a bitter
blow at Wulnoth.</p>

<p>The Wanderer sprang back only just in time, and
even so the knife left a crimson trail on his brown arm;
and he seized his sword from where he had flung it
down.</p>

<p>"I swore to slay thee with this," he cried; "and
yet but now I thought to spare thee, seeing that I have
shamed thee who hast bitten like a dog and stabbed in
secret like a nithing. It is thy fate, and thou shalt
have it. Die, Hungwar, and go to thy brother. This
is for my father and mother, and for Edgiva and Guthred,
and for their father, the King of Lethra. Thus is
the debt paid and the story ended." And with that he
smote, and Hungwar the mighty viking lord fell back
slain.</p>

<p>Then did Alfred speak with Guthrun and ask him
whether he would yield; and Guthrun said nay, but
that he would go back to his camp and make the best
stand that he might.</p>

<p>And Edgiva the Beautiful was set free; and she
thanked Guthrun for his kindness, and went back with
Wulnoth and the King; while the vikings took up the
body of Hungwar and buried it nigh that place, and
raised a mound over it, and sang his death-song with
dark and gloomy hearts.</p>

<p>Now, back in his camp, Guthrun thought dark
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>thoughts, for his heart was heavy, and he saw not
what to do. And the Saxon King placed men all round,
so that none might come in and none might go out;
and so for a fortnight did things stand, and there was
no food amongst the Danes, and they tasted of the
hunger which they had so often made others endure.</p>

<p>Each day did the Saxon King send and ask them
whether they would yield to him, and each day they
sent back an answer that they would not. But Alfred
made no attempt to attack them, for he knew that
hunger must do its work in the end.</p>

<p>And at the end of that fortnight Guthrun called a
great meeting of all his warriors, and asked them what
should be done&mdash;</p>

<p>"We wait in vain for aid," he said, "and this
Alfred grows in power each day. Men have wearied
of our cruelty and hate us for our deeds; and methinks
sometimes that I hate myself for having taken part in
some things that have gone. Now, what can we do?
We can stay till hunger slays us&mdash;but that is not a
warrior's death."</p>

<p>"We can go forth sword in hand and die like
heroes," said one holda; and the others nodded.</p>

<p>"That is a hero death," Guthrun said, "but it is
death, and life is sweet."</p>

<p>"We may not go back to the Northland with this
shame tale," said another. "Landless and nameless
should we then be, and all men would scoff at us."</p>

<p>"This England is a fair land, and plenteous," said
Guthrun, "and here it would be good to stay."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>
<p>"And here we cannot stay, unless it be in the
death-sleep," was the reply he received.</p>

<p>"Softly," he replied. "Here we can abide as
Alfred's thanes. If we swear obedience to him, he will
give us land, and we can live in peace; and that is
better than this perpetual slaying and harrying, and
better than being slain."</p>

<p>Then the holdas were silent, and they pondered;
and at last one said gravely&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, Guthrun, the matter is thus. Alfred may
do as thou sayest if we are Christians; but Alfred will
not do so if we are worshippers of our gods. For myself,"
and he laughed bitterly, "I care little what gods
I worship, and the gods of our land have failed us."</p>

<p>Now again all the holdas bent their brows and
thought. And Guthrun spoke and said that long he had
pondered this thing; and that he felt that the gods of
the Northland were no gods, but only the creatures of
sagas; but that the Lord Christ was a God indeed, who
had been on earth amongst men, and had been spoken
with.</p>

<p>And he told them how the maiden Edgiva had
spoken with him concerning the matter; and how she
had said that Wulnoth the Wanderer was a Christian.
And he had determined to abide by the issue of the
fight; and to say that did Wulnoth conquer, then the
Lord Christ was the true God; and that if Hungwar
conquered, that the gods of the Northland were the
mightier.</p>

<p>"Ye know how the fight went," he said&mdash;"how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>Hungwar was shamed, and broken, and slain. To my
mind, the Christians' God is the true God; and if Alfred
will but make terms with us, and accept our service,
I, for my part, am right ready to accept the faith of this
land and remain here in peace."</p>

<p>Then rose one old graybeard of a warrior, and he
spoke, leaning on his axe, and his voice was deep and
full, and he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"What is life, O holdas? We know not. Nor
know we what death is, whether it be a beginning or
an end. Whence come we? We know not; nor know
we whither we go, beyond the wild dreams of the
ancient times. 'T is as when we sit around the welcome
fire in the dark winter, and without the tempest
roars. Lo, through the window a little bird comes,
storm-driven and nigh perished; and for a little space
it flutters in the light and warmth, and then flies out
into the darkness again. So are we. For a little space
we are here&mdash;we came from a darkness of which we
know nothing; and presently the death-song is sung,
and into the darkness we go again. Now, O holdas,
if this Christian creed can tell us aught of the darkness,
and make our pathway light, then I say it is a good
religion, and one for men to think of; and I for one
say Skoal to the Lord Christ if this be so."<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Long and earnestly did the Danes ponder; and
finally Guthrun himself went to King Alfred, and spoke
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>with him, saying that for a man to change his religion
simply to save his life was a poor thing, and that he
and his must know what they did, ere they accepted
the Lord Christ for their God.</p>

<p>And then did the King rejoice, not only because
he was glad that the Danes should become Christians,
but also because it helped him from a hard problem.
For, though he had conquered the Danes, he saw not
how to utterly make an end of them and drive them
out; and if they would stay and be his servants, then
they would be of help to him indeed.</p>

<p>So he talked long with Guthrun, and he sent priests
and learned men to converse with the holdas; and the
end of the matter was that Guthrun and all his host
said that they would put aside their gods, and become
Christians.</p>

<p>And then there was rejoicing throughout the land;
and on one day the host were baptized, and Wulnoth
and Guthrun at the same time, and King Alfred became
their godfather and sponsor; and together did they
kneel and receive blessing, and swear to live to the
honor of Christ the Lord.</p>

<p>Then did King Alfred give broad lands to the
Danes; and those lands in part which were most open
to attack from other invaders. East Anglia and part
of Mercia did fall to their lot, and in the very place
where they had carried fire and sword and slaughtered
King Edmund, did Guthrun build churches and walk
in God's way.</p>

<p>And these lands which the King gave to Guthrun,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>together with the land of Northumbria, became known
as the Danelagh; and so it continued for many years.</p>

<p>And of Guthrun but little more is said; only this,
that during the rest of his life he faithfully kept his
promise, and never rebelled against Alfred the King,
but ruled his people wisely, and was the King's liegeman
and friend.</p>

<p>Now, this is how Wulnoth went holmgang with
Hungwar the Dane, and slew him, and set Edgiva the
Beautiful free; and this is how Guthrun and his host
turned to the Lord Christ, and dwelt in the Danelagh.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV<br />

<small><em>How Wulnoth met with Guthred again</em></small></h2>


<p>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_281.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">N</span>ow, after these things Wulnoth
pondered long in his
mind, for he was anxious to
set out again to seek Prince
Guthred if still he might be
alive, and yet he knew not
where, in all the wide world,
he should seek.</p>

<p>Nor could Wyborga help
him, for now she was very
old and feeble, and she lived in one of the holy houses,
and rarely saw strangers.</p>

<p>But once Wulnoth saw her and asked her whither
he should go; and Wyborga told him to wait patiently
and to take the first duty that should come, and then
the way should be revealed to him.</p>

<p>"Indeed, my Princess and sweet love," Wulnoth
said to Edgiva when they talked of this thing, "I am
rather tried about this matter. In the past thy brother
put this promise upon me and I gave it right willingly;
but here from boyhood to manhood have I grown, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>I do not even know if he may be alive. I am minded
sometimes to give up this, and to take the joy which
thou dost hold out to me, if still a royal princess will
marry one who is nameless."</p>

<p>"Now, <em>nameless</em>!" laughed Edgiva proudly. "Whose
name is better known than that of Wulnoth; and has
not the King given thee broad lands for thine own?"</p>

<p>"And I am going wandering again, and leaving
them for any to do as they like with."</p>

<p>"Nay, thou hast friends in plenty, who will look
to thy possessions if thou art away. My rede is this,
Wulnoth; wait till the next duty comes, as Wyborga
has counselled thee, and then, if nothing comes of it,
I will say that thou hast searched faithfully, and that
thou canst, without shame, rest from thy labors, as
from a hopeless task."</p>

<p>"So be it, dear love," Wulnoth answered. "Thou
hast never counselled me wrongly yet, and by thy rede
will I abide."</p>

<p>Now, not long after this the King sent to call Wulnoth
to his side, and he spake to him and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, Wulnoth, my faithful friend, I have a task
for thee." And Wulnoth said gleefully&mdash;</p>

<p>"That is good hearing, King, for a man grows
rusty quickly if he be not at work."</p>

<p>"Little fear of Wulnoth growing rusty," laughed
the King, "for he is forever anxious to be doing. But
listen, friend. This is the burden of it. Thou knowest
that in Northumbria there have ever been troubles,
for the people there quarrel amongst themselves,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>Northumbrians and Danes together. Now of late,
Halfdane&mdash;ah! thou knowest him?"</p>

<p>"Right well, King," answered Wulnoth grimly.
"Well, what of him?"</p>

<p>"This Halfdane gained all power in Northumbria,
and he and his barbarians ruled as with rods of iron.
Now tidings have come that Halfdane is dead."</p>

<p>"Dead!" cried Wulnoth. "So much the worse! I
thought perchance that it was to slay him thou wouldst
have me go."</p>

<p>"What a warrior art thou, Wulnoth! thou wouldst
go against a host and laugh at it! Nay, Halfdane is
dead&mdash;slain by one of his own holdas in a drunken
brawl. Now the people of Northumbria are divided
and have no leader. The Danes have none they can
place at their head without endless quarrels following,
and the Northumbrians have no king either. Now, this
is my desire, that thou speed north to Bishop Eadred,
and urge him to seek for a chieftain to be their king&mdash;one
who will be of the Christian faith, and who
will be true to me so that I have no cause to fear war
in the north.</p>

<p>"Mercia has acknowledged me, and the Welsh are
content that I should be their champion against the
Danes, from whom they have suffered much. Cantua
has no power now, and East Anglia is held by Guthrun
for me. London welcomes me, and if the North be but
friendly, then all England will be as one, and we can
bend all our thoughts towards resisting any fresh attacks
from the Danes&mdash;for more are certain to come ere long."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>
<p>"So long as there are vikings in Denmark, and
ships to sail the sea, they will come," answered Wulnoth.
"Well, O King, I will do thy bidding and seek
out the Bishop."</p>

<p>"Methinks," said the King slowly, "I might do
worse than try to have thee made king there." But
to that Wulnoth answered quickly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, Alfred, that may not be. I am no
kingly man. I should rule by hard blows, and have
no head for the business of state. Each man to his
own trade, O King, and mine is fighting&mdash;not ruling
and law making."</p>

<p>"Perchance thou art right, Wulnoth," the King
answered. "Thou art wise at any rate, for 't is no light
task to be a king."</p>

<p>"And no king do I desire to be," answered Wulnoth;
and then he went in haste and bade adieu to
Edgiva, and saddled his horse and started off with no
better company than his sword and his axe, and his
good shield slung at his back.</p>

<p>And from Wessex he rode northwards into Mercia,
and there he met with King Guthrun, who had gone
thither on business from East Anglia; and with the
Dane he tarried a day and a night while his good steed
rested.</p>

<p>Now, Wulnoth thought that perchance Guthrun
might know something of what became of Guthred,
and he asked him if he had ever heard the sons of
Regner Lodbrok speak of the matter.</p>

<p>"Ay," answered Guthrun, "and I have often thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>that it was but a poor thing to sell a lad, and a king's
son, into slavery, for that is what they did. I know
not of a certainty, but I heard that the boy was
sold to a Danish holda, who soon afterwards sailed
for England in the days when the first invasion was.
That is all I know. Most likely he has died long
since."</p>

<p>"I fear that it must be so," sighed Wulnoth, and
his heart felt sad as he thought of a king's son sold into
such slavery. But then he thought of what Wyborga
had said&mdash;how she had prophesied that he and the
Prince and Edgiva should all meet again, and the
Prince should reign in another land; and that seemed
a very hard saying to him.</p>

<p>Well, after bidding farewell to Guthrun, Wulnoth
resumed his journey and rode northwards; and everywhere
he saw the tokens of the bad times that had
been, for the land lay desolate and lonely, and there
were no people to till it. And in those fields where the
grass grew darkest and longest he knew that the war
game had been played, and that the grass grew because
men lay buried beneath.</p>

<p>For a great part of the way his road led through
vast forests, of which many abounded in England in
those days, or across wild and desolate plains and over
steep rocky hills; and so he journeyed through the
realm of Mercia and came at length into the confines
of Northumbria. Here the signs of cruel war were
even more frequent, and he passed whole towns which
were only deserted, smoke-blackened ruins now, where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>still the bones of men lay, picked clean by wild dogs or
wolves.</p>

<p>Thus his road led, nor was it without adventure
that he journeyed, for twice was he attacked by masterless
men, and had to swing his axe and deal lusty blows
ere he could pass on.</p>

<p>But such things troubled Wulnoth little, for the
robbers were but half-hearted, as every one appeared
to be, and trouble and dismay seemed everywhere.</p>

<p>"Now," thought Wulnoth to himself, "in sooth
the King is wise. It would be a good thing to have a
wise ruler here&mdash;one who would bring things to order
again and lay the land under the plough. 'T is a shame
to see it all idle like this, and makes a man feel that
the war game is evil, and not good, no matter how it
seems in the heat of the fight."</p>

<p>For two days Wulnoth rode, asking for tidings of
the Bishop, and hearing from those who cared to return
a civil answer&mdash;and that was not all&mdash;that he was
still farther northward, seeking to lead the people to
Christ.</p>

<p>Now it chanced, as he rode forward through a
wood, that he suddenly heard the sounds of strife,
and, putting spurs to his horse, he galloped forward,
guided by the sounds, and came upon four masterless
men&mdash;black-haired Danes every one&mdash;who had surrounded
a man and were seeking to slay him, while
he, with his back to a tree, flourished a long staff and
kept them at bay.</p>

<p>"Hallo, nithings! rascals!" thundered Wulnoth as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>he came upon the scene. "What, four to one, and he
unarmed! Shame upon you! If you want to play
that game, here is one who is ready for it." And with
that he smote one knave a lusty blow and sent him
sprawling, while the man cracked the pate of another,
and the remaining pair ran away as fast as their legs
could carry them.</p>

<p>"Thou art come in good time, friend," the man
said, leaning on his staff and gazing at the Wanderer;
and at the sound of that voice Wulnoth started and
stared anxiously.</p>

<p>Poorly dressed was this man, and his brow was
careworn, and around his neck he wore a thrall collar;
but for all that, and for the many years which had
passed, Wulnoth knew him&mdash;his heart went out, and
recognized, and he felt, with wonder and thankfulness,
that Wyborga's words had come true, and that he had
found his friend the Prince.</p>

<p>"Thou art welcome, friend," he said; "by what
name art thou called?"</p>

<p>"By the name of Gurth," was the answer, and Wulnoth
laughed&mdash;</p>

<p>"That may be, but there are some in the world
who know you by another name and would call you,
not Gurth the Thrall, but Guthred the Prince."</p>

<p>Then did Guthred stare, and pass his hands across
his brow, and say&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who art thou, stranger, who callest me by a name
now long forgotten&mdash;so long forgotten, indeed, that it
has almost passed from my memory?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>
<p>"Who am I?" cried Wulnoth. "I am one who
made a promise and has been all his life trying to
keep it&mdash;and now has found the chance. Guthred, my
brother and my Prince, have you forgotten Wulnoth?"</p>

<p>"Wulnoth!" cried the other, trembling with emotion.
"Wulnoth! Thou Wulnoth! Nay, I can see now.
I can see the same bold yet kindly eyes, the same
strong form! Wulnoth, my friend, my friend, at last
thou hast come to cheer me in my loneliness!"</p>

<p>And then did these two embrace, and, though they
were men grown, they shed tears. And they sat down
side by side, and allowed the two wounded thieves to
slip off, for, as Wulnoth said, they owed them a kindness,
since had they not attacked Guthred he would
never have found him.</p>

<p>And Wulnoth told all his story of his journeyings,
and of the death of Hubba and Hungwar, and of how
Edgiva was with Alfred the King, and old Wyborga
still lived, though she was feeble and old. And Guthred
told him of his sorrows and trials, and how his master
had died and left him to his widow, and the old woman
was cross and crabbed, and fond of beating her servants,
so that ofttimes Guthred had been tempted to
run away and become a masterless man himself.</p>

<p>"Yet I tarried, Wulnoth," he said, "for ofttimes I
have dreamt that you would come; and I have seen
a gray and noble-looking old man, who has placed a
crown upon my head and hailed me king of the north."</p>

<p>"Now, that is passing strange!" mused Wulnoth,
"and I remember how that Wyborga said that thou
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>shouldst become a king of a vaster kingdom than was
Lethra. There is much to think of here, my friend&mdash;much
that puzzles my comprehension and&mdash;"</p>

<p>But then a shrill voice broke upon their talk, and
they saw a gaunt cross-looking old crone, clad in
wealthy garments and being driven upon a mule
through the wood.</p>

<p>"My mistress!" said Guthred in low tones, and
Wulnoth thought of the neatherd's wife.</p>

<p>"There he is, the lazy rascal!" she cried. "Gossiping
with a stranger instead of attending to his work.
Thy back shall smart for this, sirrah, believe me, when
thou art home."</p>

<p>"Now, nay, most beautiful lady," said Wulnoth;
"the blame&mdash;if blame there be&mdash;is mine. Know that
four knaves attacked thy servant, demanding that he
give up thy property, which I see he carried at his
girdle. And he defended himself in a most worthy
way, though armed only with his stick, and I came to
his aid and, as a reward, asked him to tell me of the
whereabouts of Bishop Eadred."</p>

<p>"Beshrew Bishop Eadred&mdash;he makes men discontented
and lazy with his talk of all being brethren. Still,
he is a brave man, who keeps a bold front, let the
danger be what it may. Now, as thou hast done me
the service to preserve my slave and my money&mdash;like
as not he would have run off with it and have joined
the thieves himself&mdash;still, I say, since thou hast done
this and hast, moreover, a civil tongue&mdash;a most uncommon
thing amongst men in these days&mdash;therefore,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>my man shall be thy guide and shall lead thee to the
Bishop's dwelling if it will do thee service."</p>

<p>"Your goodness is indeed great, most dear lady,"
replied Wulnoth, "and I will humbly avail myself of
it, and kiss my hand to you." And with that he beckoned
to Guthred, saying aloud, "Come, knave, and rejoice
that thou hast so good a mistress and one so fair."</p>

<p>Guthred followed, dumb with surprise, for the
woman was most ill-favored; but when Wulnoth had
ridden on in silence for a space, and they were safely out
of sight and hearing, he looked round at his companion
and then fell to laughing so much that he nigh rolled
from his horse.</p>

<p>"Thou dost look surprised, dear friend," he said.
"I almost laughed aloud before that old beldam when
I caught sight of thy face."</p>

<p>"How didst thou learn such subtlety, Wulnoth?"
asked Guthred. "'T is not as thou usedst to be."</p>

<p>"Marry! I learnt it from a neatherd in the Southland,"
answered Wulnoth, "and a king told me of it.
Moreover, Guthred, many things have come true, and
I have indeed helped to place that king's crown firmly
upon his head, and I am his friend. And I think the
rest shall come true also, for I know of the thorn cross
now, and I thank God that I do."</p>

<p>"I have heard," answered Guthred. And Wulnoth
asked&mdash;</p>

<p>"And you believe it?"</p>

<p>"I know not. I have never thought seriously; and
yet the story is a good one, and sometimes when I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>have been cast down it has comforted me. And so thou
dost find the prophecy coming true, Wulnoth! Will it
come true even to marrying a king's daughter?"</p>

<p>"Guthred," said Wulnoth gravely, "and if I said
yes to that, would you say nay?"</p>

<p>"I! Who am I to say nay, Wulnoth? You mock
me! I am a thrall, and forgotten. Nay, if it be that
Edgiva, my sister, says yes, Guthred, her brother will
not say nay."</p>

<p>"Yes she will say, when I tell her that this last
quest is over. As to the thraldom and the crown, that
is as it may be; but I have a thought."</p>

<p>"Tell me of this neatherd," said Guthred. And
Wulnoth told him the story, and how the man had
made his wife do as he desired, simply by doing as
she bade him; whereat even the poor Prince laughed
heartily.</p>

<p>Now when the pair reached the dwelling where
Bishop Eadred tarried, Wulnoth directed the Prince to
await him in an outer apartment, while he went to give
the King's message; and Guthred asked why he need
wait, seeing that his task was done now.</p>

<p>"You wait, friend," answered Wulnoth; and Guthred
was content.</p>

<p>And the Bishop greeted Wulnoth warmly, and
asked him all the tidings, and rejoiced to hear of his
being a Christian, saying that he had heard of Guthrun's
conversion from certain of the Danes.</p>

<p>And Wulnoth gave him the King's message, and
Bishop Eadred looked grave and shook his head.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>
<p>"Wulnoth," he said, "thinkest thou not that I have
pondered this matter? And, strangely enough, thrice
have I in my dreams placed the crown of Northumbria
upon the head of an unknown man, and that man
dressed in a churl's dress, and wearing a thrall's collar.
Who is this man, and what does this dream mean?"</p>

<p>"Would you know the man if you saw him?"
asked Wulnoth; and the Bishop said that he would.</p>

<p>"Then," answered Wulnoth, "go into the outer
room and you will see him seated there and awaiting
me."</p>

<p>Now, at this the Bishop was bewildered, but he
complied; and when he saw Guthred, he cried out that
it was the man of his dream; and Guthred said that
the Bishop was the one whom he had seen; and both
they and Wulnoth were filled with wonder, and marvelled
at the ways of God.</p>

<p>And Wulnoth told Bishop Eadred who this man
was, and all the story; and the Bishop talked long with
Guthred, and Guthred confessed that he did believe in
the Lord, though he had always been afraid to say so,
because his mistress pretended to believe in the old
Norse gods.</p>

<p>"Now," cried Bishop Eadred, "surely this is the
guiding of Heaven. Go ye back, Wulnoth, to the King,
and take Guthred with you and&mdash;nay, better still&mdash;let
Guthred tarry here, and return to his mistress, while
you go to the King. Tell him everything, and ask if
it will not be well to set Guthred over the land of
Northumbria."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>
<p>"Gladly will I do this thing," cried Wulnoth; "and
if ever my horse travelled, he must travel now."</p>

<p>So Guthred, saying nothing, went back to his toil,
and Wulnoth started on his journey; and for two days
and nights he journeyed, and then he came to the
King's house, and Alfred greeted him in wonder and
asked mildly why he had returned so quickly.</p>

<p>"I have returned, O King," he cried, "because
methinks that the thing which thou desirest is done,
and the man whom thou wouldst like to be king is
found."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said the King; "and who may the man
be, Wulnoth?"</p>

<p>"The man whom I have journeyed far to find, O
King," Wulnoth said. "I have found Guthred the
Prince, the brother of Edgiva." And thereat the King
looked amazed, and made Wulnoth sit and tell him
all the story.</p>

<p>And when this was done, the King said that indeed
Guthred was a fit man to be King of Northumbria.</p>

<p>"He is of the old stock," he said, "and in the
direct line. Ay, let this be, if it may. Travel back yet
once more&mdash;well may we call you 'Wanderer'&mdash;and
when all is ready, if the people will listen to advice and
do this thing, then I will journey down; and perchance
Edgiva will be glad to see her brother, and a crowning
may also mean a wedding"; and thereat the King
smiled.</p>

<p>So Wulnoth hurried to see Edgiva, and to tell her
the news, and how her brother fared, and what the King
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>purposed; and then he once more set out on his journey,
and without adventure came to Northumbria.</p>

<p>Now, this is how Wulnoth found Guthred the
Prince, and how it was purposed to give a thrall the
crown of Northumbria.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV<br />

<small><em>The Crowning of Guthred</em></small></h2>


<p>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_295.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">W</span>ith haste and gladness did
Wulnoth set out for the
North once more, and all the
world seemed filled with a
love-song and a joy-song as
he rode upon his way.</p>

<p>For the sun was shining
at last for him, and for those
whom he loved, and, better
still, for all the land of England;
and Alfred the King, who had labored so long
and so patiently to weld the land into one strong people,
would now have his reward also, in seeing the prosperity
of his kingdom.</p>

<p>And Wulnoth reflected as he journeyed, for he was
a man given to thinking when he was alone, that all
this happiness had its fount in the truth concerning the
Lord Jesus; and he remembered how Wyborga had
said, in the long ago of his childhood, that the story of
the thorn cross turned darkness to light, weakness to
strength, and sorrow into joy; and lo, this was happening
throughout the length and breadth of England.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>
<p>And then he thought of the differences between the
Danes and the Saxons; and yet these people were almost
from the same stock and the same land, and both
peoples had ever been lovers of the war game, and sea-lords
and vikings at heart. And those differences all
sprang from the same source&mdash;the Saxons had turned
to the White Christ, and the Danes still worshipped
the old cruel gods of the Northland.</p>

<p>Like the wind his good horse journeyed, and in
good time he arrived at the Bishop's house, and told him
of King Alfred's pleasure in the matter; and at that
the Bishop smiled, and said that the way was a clear way
now.</p>

<p>"But how will you make these people accept Guthred
for their king?" asked Wulnoth. "If they be not
willing, then it can only be done by the sword, and there
is more war and desolation."</p>

<p>"God save us from that," said the Bishop. "Nay,
friend, it is because the people are weary of war that I
hope for success. They of Northumbria have long ago
turned from their old gods, though in form they serve
them still; and many have pondered about the Lord
Christ, even as Guthred has done. Moreover, the tidings
that Guthrun and they of the Danelagh have become
Christians has not been without effect; and even
the Danes are weary of the old, and are asking whether
the new faith be not better.</p>

<p>"Now, the Danes will not accept one of Northumbria
for leader, and the people of the land will not accept
one of the Danes; so that there is like to be war again,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>which neither side really desires. But if Guthred, who
is of the royal blood and ancient line, is put forward, he
will satisfy the claims of both parties, and in him the
two may unite into one. That is my hope. For, look
you, these Danes know full well that presently other
sea-lords will sweep down on the land&mdash;lords who
know them not, and who may serve them as they have
served others, and take from them that which they have
won. They will therefore the more willingly unite with
the Northumbrian people, and seek to present a strong
front to any new foe who may come."</p>

<p>"Thy words may well be true words," answered
Wulnoth; "and now that I have done my task, I go
to speak with Guthred my friend."</p>

<p>"See you tell him nothing of this, good Wulnoth,"
said the Bishop in warning. "No word, that is, where
others may hear it spoken. For a secret once whispered
is as a message sounded by trumpet; and a woman's
tongue is as the crier's voice, and spreads news even
more swiftly. We must keep this business quiet, until
we have the holdas and thanes upon our side."</p>

<p>"I will be most careful," answered Wulnoth; and
with that he set out. But he went not to the house of
Guthred's mistress, for he had no mind to listen to the
tongue of a <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'scoldng'">scolding</ins> jade, if it might be avoided. But
he lurked in the woodlands; and so presently he saw
Guthred come forth, and he hailed him, and together
they went into the forest depths, and there did the
Wanderer tell him of the King's wish, and the Bishop's
work, and how the word of Wyborga would yet be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>found a true word, and Guthred would be king of a
land vaster and more powerful than ever ancient Lethra
had been.</p>

<p>And then did Bishop Eadred set himself to work,
and he summoned by message all the holdas and thanes,
and begged them to come to a council with himself,
as he had weighty things to say to them.</p>

<p>And because he was a wise man, and learned, and
just in his ways, the holdas and thanes came, even those
who were at enmity; and for the time they proclaimed
truce, and sat in the Bishop's house, and asked him
whereof he had to speak.</p>

<p>And the Bishop stood and spoke of his dreams, and
how he had met the man whom he had seen in his night
visions; and how this man had also seen him in his
visions; and the Bishop asked who but the blessed
Saint Cuthbert, whose abbey of Lindisfarne was almost
in ruins, should have been permitted by Heaven to put
these dreams into their heads?</p>

<p>But the men of Northumbria cried that they would
have no churl to be their king; but that one of the old
royal House of Ella should be found; and the Danes
laughed, and said that they cared not for the man's birth,
so that he was a true man and one able to lead them.</p>

<p>But one aged holda rose and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Suppose, instead of quarrelling, and drawing of
swords, we see this man of whom the Bishop speaks. If
we like him not, then can we say nay. It will be better
than quarrelling as those who quarrel in the dark about
they know not what."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>
<p>"The man is by Heaven destined," the Bishop said.
"Here is one who can tell you of him," and he pointed
to Wulnoth.</p>

<p>So Wulnoth stood there, and he told them the story
of Guthred, Prince of Lethra, and of the prophesying
of Wyborga the Wise in the long ago, and of all that
had happened since. And he showed how Guthred was
of the royal blood of Lethra, and how Hardacnute himself
was of the old race; and both Danes and Northumbrians
cried aloud that if this was so, then Guthred
the son of Hardacnute was he who should be their king.</p>

<p>"We will stand for him," they cried, "and we will
war against all in the land who seek to reject him."</p>

<p>"Little need for war," said the Bishop. "Know,
thanes and holdas, that now all England is united beneath
the rule of Alfred the Bretwalda. Guthrun is now
his liegeman, and Guthred will also call Alfred overlord.
Thus all the land from the Picts' wall in the north,
to the sea in the south, will be one land, and its peoples
as one people; and the strong will stand for the weak,
and each call his neighbor brother. And this is the law
of the Lord Christ, who is Alfred's Lord, and Guthrun's
Lord, and shall be Guthred's Lord also."</p>

<p>Then did all the warriors and leaders cry that the
thing was good, and they demanded to be led to the
place where Guthred was; and Wulnoth could not help
smiling as he thought of what the old woman would say
when all the land came to take her thrall and crown
him king.</p>

<p>So to the house he led them, the great, grim viking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>lords and the best of the thanes; and behind them came
many of their warriors, and they shouted with a mighty
voice, and cried&mdash;</p>

<p>"Skoal! Skoal to thee, Guthred the Prince, who
shalt be Guthred the King! Come forth to us, that we
may see him who shall wear the crown and the royal
bracelets."</p>

<p>And then did the old woman come running out, and
she cried out, and bade them begone for a set of drunken
rascals.</p>

<p>"Must you come with your folly to an honest
woman's house, shouting for your king? Guthred! I
have no Guthred here, and that you wot right well;
but if ye want a king, go round to the sty and get one
there, or to the field wherein my ass feeds, and he will
make ye a good ruler. Away with ye, rascals and
worthless that ye are, or I will beat you with my besom
stick."</p>

<p>Then did the vikings laugh again, and still they
cried for Guthred to come forth; and at that did
Guthred come, and Wulnoth cried so that all might
hear&mdash;</p>

<p>"The man is here, holdas and thanes. This is my
friend and my brother&mdash;this is Guthred, who is son of
him who was King of Lethra."</p>

<p>"Skoal! Skoal to thee, Guthred son of Hardacnute!"
they cried; and they seized him and lifted him
onto their shoulders.</p>

<p>But then, with a yell and a cry of anger, the old
woman threw herself amongst them, and she scratched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>and kicked, and grabbed hold of Guthred's leg, seeking
to pull him away.</p>

<p>"Hola! help, there&mdash;help there, neighbors!" she
cried. "Here be nameless and masterless men, and
they be carrying off my thrall! Help, there."</p>

<p>"Silence, woman!" sternly said the Bishop.
"Darest thou call these nobles by such shameful names
as nameless and masterless? Silence, or thou shalt be
ducked in the pond. As for this man, know that he
is thy king; and ask his pardon if thou hast cause to
fear his anger, for thy life is in his hand, from now,
henceforth."</p>

<p>"What!" shrieked the old woman. "What is
that? Gurth is not Gurth, but Guthred; and he is
not my thrall, but the King! Oh, and I have had him
whipped! Oh, and I have had him shut up! And now
he will have me killed. Oh! mercy, good Gurth&mdash;I
mean, good Guthred&mdash;no, I mean good King! Oh,
mercy!"</p>

<p>But Guthred laughed, and it was the good laugh
of the long ago; and he held out his hand, and lifted
the woman up, saying to her&mdash;</p>

<p>"Have no fear, mistress. If I was whipped, doubtless
I deserved it."</p>

<p>"You did, every bit and more!" cried the woman,
anxious to justify herself. But then she remembered
that she was speaking to the King, and she stammered&mdash;"No&mdash;I
mean that you didn't deserve it. No, that
won't do! If I say that you deserved it, that is wrong
to say of the King, and if I say that you didn't deserve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>it, that is contradicting you, and that is wrong, so what
is a poor body to do?"</p>

<p>"Say nothing about it," answered Guthred. But at
that Wulnoth laughed.</p>

<p>"Come, come, Prince, do not set her so hard a task&mdash;her
tongue is too long, and it wags so freely that she
must talk." And at that the woman glared at her tormentor,
and seemed inclined to show him that her nails
were long also.</p>

<p>But Guthred said that he was this woman's thrall,
and that if they wanted him for King they must purchase
him from her, and he decreed that if he was worth
crowning he was worth his weight in gold, and at that
all the holdas laughed. And they set up a beam and
weighed golden bracelets against him; and that was the
price they paid for Guthred to make him their king.</p>

<p>And then did they take him away and strip from
him his humble robes and array him in the garments
of a great holda, as was his by right, and they gave
him homage.</p>

<p>And then, messages having been sent south, Alfred
the King set forth for the Northland, and with him
came his Queen and Edgiva the Beautiful, and in a litter
old Wyborga, who said that now her task was over and
her word had come to pass, and therefore she would
see Guthred crowned, and one more thing accomplished,
ere she closed her eyes in death.</p>

<p>And with a great retinue into Northumbria came
Alfred; and Guthred, and the thanes, and the holdas
awaited his coming, and all cried "Skoal" to him; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>Guthred came and knelt and kissed his hand, and did
him homage as his overlord and Bretwalda.</p>

<p>And Alfred raised Guthred and embraced him, and
called him his brother, and greeted thanes and holdas
as his friends, and there was rejoicing in all the land.</p>

<p>But who shall speak of the meeting of Guthred
with Edgiva his beautiful sister, after so many years
of absence? Ah, it was good for the Prince to look
upon her beauty and to hear her voice, and hard was it
for him to remember that all the ills had passed away,
and that he was as a king now and would soon be
crowned.</p>

<p>And to old Wyborga did he go and kneel and ask
her blessing. And Wyborga laid her hand upon his
head and blessed him, and also Wulnoth and Edgiva;
and she said gladly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now the end is near, and I also am going to my
crowning, and you, my children, have to tarry until it
is the Lord's will to call you. My words have come
true, and you three are united, now that you know the
meaning of the thorn-crowned cross. Yea, and you,
Wulnoth, you mighty man, have helped to plant it
firmly in this land when it was in danger of being uprooted;
and you have aided two kings to be crowned.
Hard has been your fight, Wulnoth, and like a hero
have you conquered; and ere I die your reward shall be
sure."</p>

<p>And then did Wulnoth ask Wyborga of a thing
which had long worried him.</p>

<p>"Where is he, good mother, with whom I wrestled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>so often?" he said, "and what is the meaning of his
riddle?"</p>

<p>"Thou hast slain him at last, Wulnoth," she answered
softly, "or I should say that thy dear Lord has
slain him for thee. For indeed he was thyself&mdash;thy
evil spirit, Wulnoth. The Wulnoth who desired the
things of earth, and the pride of life, and the lust of the
flesh. Wulnoth, though all may not know it, each
one who serves the Lord must so fight with himself,
and if he fights beneath the cross, he wins, but if he
fights in his own strength he is vanquished; and if self
is not conquered, then it is master forever, and leads
the better will and desire in thraldom."</p>

<p>So did Wyborga say, and long did Wulnoth ponder,
for the thing was as a strange, strange thing to him;
yet he could see that always this being had sought to
lead him from the way of duty into the way of desire,
and he rejoiced that he had striven and overcome, as
he had done.</p>

<p>Now, after this did the holdas and thanes, and all
the people, come and take Guthred, and lead him away
to the sacred stone&mdash;at least, now that they were departing
from the old gods they looked upon it as sacred
no longer&mdash;but because always their kings had been
proclaimed there, they took Guthred also; and the stone
is on a hill named Oswin's Dune.</p>

<p>And then they placed upon his arms the royal
bracelets, and upon his head the golden circlet, and
hailed him as King of Northumbria and overlord of
every thane and holda there. And Guthred took off his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>crown and laid it before Alfred, and Alfred placed it
again upon his head; and the two kings sat side by
side and drank heal to each other, and Wulnoth stood
beside his friend and brother Guthred, and Edgiva sat
at his side.</p>

<p>Then from thence did Guthred go to Lindisfarne
Abbey, and there was he baptized by the Bishop, and
there did he profess his Lord, and vow to rebuild the
Abbey and set it in order. And he gave broad lands to
the Bishop to be held for the Church; and from that gift
made by Guthred the King it comes that right down to
this very day, the Bishop of Durham may, if he chooses,
don his scarlet robes and seat himself beside the judges
whenever they come to try criminals within what is
called his palatinate&mdash;that is, the boundaries of those
lands which were given to Bishop Eadred, in the days
of his crowning by Guthred.</p>

<p>And this is how the people of Northumbria chose
Guthred for their king, and the words spoken of old
by Wyborga came true in the end.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI<br />

<small><em>Of the Wedding of Wulnoth and Edgiva</em></small></h2>


<p>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_306.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">N</span>ow, on the evening of that
day whereon Guthred was
crowned at Oswin's Dune,
Wulnoth stood alone in the
gathering shadows, pondering
on all that had taken
place, and it was as peace
time in his heart.</p>

<p>He was happy, very
happy, and first of all because
now he knew the happiness which comes from
the story of the thorn-wreathed cross; and then because
he saw his friend and brother, Guthred, now no
longer a poor thrall, but a king, and the friend of Alfred
the Bretwalda. That was a good thing in the eyes of
Wulnoth, and right glad was he that he had fulfilled
his word and had never turned aside from seeking for
Guthred.</p>

<p>And he was happy because his Princess was happy
in her brother's joy. It had been good for him to watch
her face and see the light play upon it, as the sunlight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>plays upon the meadows and the lakes when, in the
morning, it first rises above the hills and peeps down
into the sleepy valleys at their feet.</p>

<p>And yet there was another cause for joy, and it
was a deep, deep cause, as a deep well wherein is cool
clear water, and around which cluster the nodding ferns.
For now he thought that his tasks were over, and he
might truly whisper his love-song into the ears of Edgiva,
knowing that though she was a king's daughter,
and the sister of a king, she would listen to his tale
more gladly than she would heed the words of the
greatest and mightiest in the land.</p>

<p>So he stood thinking his own thoughts, and the
shadows grew and the moon rose, and then an owl
hooted in the woods, and his mind went back to the
days when, with brave Wahrmund, he had stood in the
woods of East Anglia and had heard the sign which first
called Alfred to his side.</p>

<p>But after the owl, there came the sound of another
song&mdash;the song of a tiny night-singer telling his love
tale to his little mate, and the song flowed like a stream
of melody, like the purling of the brooklet in the moonlight,
like the voice of the wavelets on the shelly sands,
like the whispering of the night wind to the bending
trees.</p>

<p>It got into the heart of Wulnoth, and he stood
listening, a smile on his face, and he thought how much
better this was than the song of the sword or the hiss
of the flames as they burst through the roof, and he said
softly&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>
<p>"Sing, sing, little bird&mdash;sing to thy shy mate
whom thou lovest; but though I may not sing as
sweetly, thy song is no gladder than is mine when I
think of my Princess. O night-singer, would that I
could learn thy song and so sing to my love&mdash;to my
Edgiva!"</p>

<p>Then a little voice spoke in his ear, and a little
hand stole around his neck, and the voice said softly&mdash;</p>

<p>"But, perchance, thy Edgiva might better love to
hear thy words in thine own voice than in the sweetest
tones of the night-singer, Wulnoth."</p>

<p>And he turned and beheld his Princess, and he
took her in his arms, and she made no struggle, but
yielded gladly as a tired bird nestles in its nest; and
she turned her face towards his own and called him
Wulnoth, and love, and hero, and true one; and it was
happy peace time for them both.</p>

<p>"All the world seems beautiful, dear love," he said
to her. "It is like the land of the fairies to my eyes,
such is the happiness that comes from love that has
found its answer and its mate."</p>

<p>"Dearest," she said, "perchance also it is because
of a greater happiness which comes to us from Him
Whom we serve. We have found the meaning of Wyborga's
sign now, sweetheart, though it seemed so
strange to us when we were children away there in
Lethra."</p>

<p>And so they two stood, and their hearts were too
full for speech, yet in their very silence they seemed
to talk and tell each other of their love, which had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>grown and grown all through the long years of their
waiting.</p>

<p>And while they stood thus, from the shadows came
the sound of a harp and the voice of a singer, and thus
the unseen sang&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>Then did the song cease, and to them came Alfred
the King, and he smiled and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"You, my Wulnoth, and you, sweet Edgiva&mdash;you
who have been so faithful to me in the days of my
trial&mdash;am I unkind that I thus come and spoil your
song with my poor music? If that is so, forgive me,
for I came that I might seek to repay in part all that
you have done for me."</p>

<p>"Alfred is ever welcome," said Edgiva, and so said
Wulnoth; but the King laughed and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, nay. Not even Alfred is welcome when he
comes to stop such sweet tales as yours. But this is
the matter of it, dear friends. There should be something
done this night without which the joy of this
day will be incomplete, and wot ye what that something
is?"</p>

<p>Now at that Edgiva grew rosy red and turned
her face away, for in great joy and in great desire,
sometimes the shame thought comes, as if 't were
wrong to be glad at that which the heart most longs
for.</p>

<p>But Wulnoth looked down at the dear one by his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>side, and he turned the little face towards his own love-filled
eyes, and he spake and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"My Princess, of old I was thy watcher, and who
should be so good a watcher as thy husband? Now,
dear heart, thou hast heard the words of the King, and
thou dost know all the words that my heart would
speak; but how is it with thee, my Princess? Wilt
thou give me this my great reward, as the King has
said, for surely never could be better time than now?"</p>

<p>"Dost want debts paid so quickly, Wulnoth?" she
asked. And he answered gravely&mdash;</p>

<p>"Nay, not if the paying is heavy to thee, my
Princess. Nor indeed do I want a debt paid at all.
All that I have done I give thee freely, and all that I
crave from thee I crave as a free gift."</p>

<p>"Why, dear heart," the Princess said softly, "I
must not jest with thee, for thou, who art so great and
so strong, dost take all things seriously. Canst doubt,
dearest, that I give freely that which thou dost covet,
and give gladly because in the giving I get my greatest
joy? I think I have loved thee, Wulnoth, ever
since I can remember. I loved thee when thou didst
slay the bear, and when thou didst tread the birds'
road for me, and when thou didst refuse to tarry in
the forest and make thy love a forest queen, and I
loved thee most when thou wast too honest to pretend
to a faith which thou didst not feel, in order that thou
mightest win thy desire easily. I love thee, my Wulnoth,
and what can I say more save this&mdash;let it be as
the King commands."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>
<p>"Now by my troth!" cried the King right merrily,
"would we had all our subjects as willing and docile.
But forgive me, Edgiva, well named the Beautiful, nor
think it too much kindness that I show; for, by my
kingdom, if we keep thee unmated much longer, now
that we have peace time and men have leisure to think,
we shall have all the land quarrelling about thee, and
Wulnoth will either have to kill or be killed."</p>

<p>With such merry words did Alfred speak, seeking
to put them at peace; and then together did they all
enter the hall where, amidst the thanes and holdas, the
King sat feasting and listening to the gleemen. And to
them did Guthred say&mdash;</p>

<p>"Greeting, fair sister, and greeting, Wulnoth, friend
and brother. We have missed you from the feast; and
doubtless ye have had better things to think of than
our poor company." And Wulnoth answered with a
smile&mdash;</p>

<p>"Much better things, O King." Whereat all there
laughed.</p>

<p>"Now I see that Wulnoth will never be found
when he is needed," cried one holda. "What say ye,
comrades? How shall we prevent this trouble?"</p>

<p>"Marry, cure him in the only way he can be cured,"
answered another with a grim twinkle in his eye. "Let
the lovers mate, and ever after Wulnoth will be found
ready to go on the King's business. 'T is the best cure
I wot of, and it did not fail in my case, and that was
bad enough."</p>

<p>Then did the warriors laugh again until the hall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>rang; for they knew that the old soldier had married
a shrew, who gave him no peace until she did him the
kindness to die.</p>

<p>But King Alfred rose, and then all grew silent;
and he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Friends, holdas, and thanes, and you, royal Guthred,
jest and merriment are good in their place, and
this is their place; and yet there is that which is solemn.
For true love, faithfully kept through long years, is a
solemn thing, and a holy thing, and that whereon we
may ask the blessing of the Lord; and such love hath
been that of Wulnoth my friend, and of Edgiva the
Beautiful. And now methinks that that which has been
done this day will not be complete unless there is
another deed done." And at this all the soldiers rose
and held their drinking horns aloft, and cried, "Waes
heal to Wulnoth the Wanderer, and to Edgiva the
Beautiful."</p>

<p>"Nay, not the Wanderer now," cried the King,
"for I make Wulnoth Lord of Cantua, and of the
marches which border East Anglia and Guthrun's
realm; and to him I give overship of my ports, and
charge of my long ships, and him I make one of the
chiefest thanes of the south, and appoint him the keeper
of the King's banner during all his life."</p>

<p>"Skoal! Skoal! Wulnoth, warden of the marches,"
they cried. "Skoal to thee and to the fair one who
shall be thy bride! Skoal, and joy time to you both!"</p>

<p>Then did Guthred rise and take Wulnoth's hand,
and he said&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>
<p>"Little have I to say adding to the words of the
King, Wulnoth, friend and brother. Only this: never
had man more faithful friend than I have had in thee,
and never did man more deserve his reward than thou
dost deserve thine. This thing was told in the long
ago, and now it is, and who shall say it nay? Therefore
do I kiss my sister, and give her to thee, and may
joy time and peace time be for you both."</p>

<p>And then did the Bishop come, and Wulnoth and
Edgiva the Beautiful stood before him; and never had
the Beautiful looked sweeter and fairer than now,
though from girlhood to womanhood she had grown
waiting, and sometimes knowing wandering and want
when from the Danes she had been forced to hide.
And there before all men did they stand, and the two
kings stood by, and the Bishop joined their hands, and
Alfred himself gave a ring from his own finger, set
with precious stones, wherewith the lovers plighted
their solemn troth the one to the other.</p>

<p>And thus did Wulnoth gain his reward, and Edgiva
the Beautiful became his wife, and the joy came to
them, even as Wyborga the Wise had said that it would
come.</p>

<p>And that very night did they go and kiss Wyborga;
and she smiled and folded her hands, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I did but tarry for this, my children. Now all
my task is done, and I go to my Lord; and may He
guide you all the way and bring you to Himself at the
end."</p>

<p>So said Wyborga the Wise, and she turned on her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>couch to sleep; and when they came to waken her in
the morning, lo, she lay in the majesty of death; and
the old wrinkled face seemed to have grown younger,
and the silver locks lay smooth on either cheek, and
her face was as the dignified face of majesty, yet gentle
and gracious as a holy saint.</p>

<p>And they wept for Wyborga, those three who had
most cause to think of her; but Alfred the Bretwalda
said softly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Weep not for her, for she has looked in the face
of her Lord, and behold, she has life, and youth, and
immortality forever."</p>

<p>Now, this is how Wulnoth and Edgiva were united,
and this is how the Wise Wyborga went to her Lord
when her work was accomplished.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII<br />

<small><em>Skoal!</em></small></h2>


<p>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_316.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">T</span>o the longest day the night
must follow, and to the best
song an end must come; and
so it is with the song of
Wulnoth.</p>

<p>And truly, the song
might have ended when it
was love time and peace time,
and when he and Edgiva the
Beautiful were happy, but
that there are other things to tell; or else how happened
it that Gyso the Gleeman ever sang this song?</p>

<p>This, then, is the happening of it, though many
things can be but briefly mentioned; for he who would
sing all the wisdom and brave deeds of Alfred the Bretwalda
must needs sing a long, long song.</p>

<p>Now, though Alfred the King had beaten the Danes
and broken their power, and bound all England in one,
not a year passed without some of the Black Strangers
appearing, and many a hard fight did he have, and
many a long period had Wulnoth to be away from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>Lady Edgiva, either bearing the King's banner or defending
his ports; for these pirates seemed to grow
more numerous by being slain, and again and again
did they make their attempts to bring our fair England
beneath their rule.</p>

<p>And from Scandinavia came fresh hordes in their
ships, and sailed along the English Channel, now attacking
England, and anon France, and carrying desolation
to one or the other.</p>

<p>There was that Hrolf, or Rollo, he of whom we
have spoken, called the Ganger, or Walker, because
he was so tall and strong that no horse could bear
him. He came to England, but such a beating did he
get, that he went to France and there made war until
he at last made league with Charles the Simple, and
had the French king's daughter given to him for his
wife. And this Rollo was required to kiss the King's
hand and call him overlord; but this was not to his
mind; so, instead, he seized his foot and tipped the
King over. This Rollo was given Normandy for his
possession, and was baptized and called Robert; and
well in after days had Saxon England to rue that
Robert of Normandy ever lived, seeing that from him
sprang that Norman William who put so hard a yoke
on the Saxon shoulders.</p>

<p>Then came a mighty host&mdash;two hundred and fifty
ships sailed against the south coast, and eighty more
sailed up the Thames; and all these Alfred and his host
had to meet; and these were led by that Hastings who
of all the Danish holdas was amongst the most noble.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>
<p>And after Guthrun had died, one Eric became King
of East Anglia; and he broke troth with King Alfred,
and aided the strangers, and the war was hard in the
land.</p>

<p>And in those days did Alfred do a good thing; for
he came upon a camp of the Danes, and there were the
wife and the sons of this Hastings; and Alfred had
them in his power, and might have forced Hastings to
come to terms, but this he would not do. But he treated
the lady and the children with courtesy, and sent them
safe and unharmed to Hastings, with kingly greeting,
though some there said that it was a foolish thing that
was done. But Alfred was a true knight, and made no
war against women and children; and this thing happened
at that place which now we call Benfleet.</p>

<p>Hastings showed no gratitude, but advanced right
across England and pressed Mercia, until the King and
Wulnoth and the champions defeated him at the borders
of the river Severn, and sent him back in full retreat to
East Anglia.</p>

<p>Then did the Danes come sailing up against London,
and their ships lay thick in the Thames, just where
the river Lea joins it.</p>

<p>But Alfred built walls and drained away the water,
and the Danes could not sail out again, and had to
abandon the ships and flee back to East Anglia once
more.</p>

<p>Then they burst forth again and crossed the country
to the westward, and reached Quatbridge, and there
they encamped. But Alfred, never daunted, came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>against them, and Hastings fled; and, weary of such
a foe as the Saxon King, he sailed for France, and
came no more against the land.</p>

<p>Then Alfred busied himself, and had many long
ships built, and sent to Friesland for sailors, because
the Saxons were not good at navigating the ships. But
he had no foreigners for warriors, for his own good
Saxons, if they could not manage the sails, could handle
sword and shield and spear; and thus he raised a goodly
fleet, and drove the Danes from his seas, and delivered
his coasts.</p>

<p>And once two Danish ships were fought and conquered,
and the ships drifted ashore with all their crews,
and were destroyed, and the vikings taken prisoners.</p>

<p>And now for once Alfred was not mild; for he had
the men brought to his city of Winchester, and there
he had them all hanged, man by man, and spared none.
And in later days some have tried to cry shame on the
King for this; but perchance if they had lived in his
day, and seen the harrying and the burning, and had,
like him, done nothing to bring the foe, but had dealt
with them gently and fairly&mdash;if they had done this,
they might perhaps have been quite as ready to teach
the Danes a lesson, seeing that kindness was of no avail,
and to hang the crews, as Alfred the Bretwalda was.</p>

<p>And through all this time of warring the King was
busy thinking for his kingdom's good. He it was who
had the Bible written in the tongue which the people
could understand. He it was who taught himself Latin
by translating sentence by sentence, what his friend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>Asser wrote for him. He taught the people how to
measure time, by having candles marked and burning
beneath glasses, so that every mark reached meant one
hour gone. He it was who wrote books that to-day
even are helpful to us&mdash;"The King's Hand-book" and
the book called "Orosius"&mdash;and the book which he
called his Family Library. Alfred it was who taught
the people the law, and who gave them trial by jury,
and the frithgild, by which each man was pledged
to aid his neighbor. And in London the guild met, in
a hall called the Guild Hall.</p>

<p>Alfred it was who made friends with all learned
men and travelled men, with Audher, who had tried to
sail northward to the pole, and with Walstan, who
sailed right to the far end of the Baltic. He it was, too,
who sent Bishop Swithelm all the way to India, to
carry greetings to the Syrian Christians who dwelt
there; and the stout old Bishop not only undertook
the journey, but returned safe, and brought gifts to the
King.</p>

<p>All these things did Alfred the King, the wisest
man in England, as he has been justly called; and all
the time he warred and defended the land from the foe;
and so he lived, and did well; and Wulnoth was his
faithful warrior, and grew gray in his wars; and then,
in the end, the King sickened and died, and all the land
mourned for him who had ruled so well and done so
wisely.</p>

<p>Now, when Alfred the King was dead, trouble came
and war again. For Edward, the son of the dead King,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>was proclaimed King, but Ethelwald, son of Ethelbald,
he also claimed the throne; and between these two of
one blood there was war and hate, and the sword-song
again; and men gathered some to one side and some
to the other and prepared for battle.</p>

<p>And then came Wulnoth, and he was now a gray-haired
champion, and amongst the wisest in the land;
and he joined Edward, for Edward was Alfred's son.
And how he wished then that Guthred were with him;
but alas! Guthred had died, and Guthred's sons were
rebellious, and kept not faith. And Guthrun was dead
also; and the Danes of the Danelagh and of Northumbria
and of East Anglia, they banded with Ethelwald,
and were led by the Danish King, Eric; and they
carried fire and sword once more, and made the sword-song
be heard, and the land wept again for the sorrow
that had come to it.</p>

<p>And the Danes and the people with Ethelwald were
more than the people with Edward, so that Alfred's son
had to flee from place to place, as the King, his father,
had done in the days passed away.</p>

<p>And then did Wulnoth send seven times to the
men of Cantua, over whom he had ruled; but they had
their hearts darkened, and they refused to come to the
King's aid, and Wulnoth grew sad, for now he thought
that the end must surely come.</p>

<p>"Now, King," said Wulnoth to Edward, "I have
seen three kings meet these Danes when their numbers
were few; and two of the three kings were slain, and
the third&mdash;thine own father&mdash;beat the foe and drove
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>them away. Now, if it is thy mind to take the chance,
let us march forward towards the borders of East
Anglia, and there on the marches we will meet the foe
and see what may be done."</p>

<p>"Let it be as thou sayest, thane," answered Edward;
"for of a truth thou art the most skilled and renowned
in the land."</p>

<p>So Wulnoth kissed Edgiva his wife, and bade her
adieu; and she looked into his face and wept; and she
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wulnoth, my husband, often hast thou gone away
to the war game, and my heart has been sad, for I have
feared for you. But now you go, and my heart is not
sad but dead, for I know that we shall meet no more
in life here, but in the life hereafter shall we meet."</p>

<p>"Cheer thee, my lady wife," he answered. "'T is
a dark saying." But she said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I know, husband. The spirit of Wyborga seems
upon me, and I know we part now, and you will no
more return alive."</p>

<p>"Why, then, lady wife," he answered, "if that be
so, the end must come when God wills. Surely you
would not have me act a nithing part, and leave the
son of Alfred in his hour of need?"</p>

<p>"Thou knowest better, husband," she made answer.
"I would have you go to duty, as you have ever gone.
Now kiss me once more, for my heart is heavy and my
spirit dark."</p>

<p>So Wulnoth kissed Edgiva and bade her farewell,
and charged her that if it should be as she feared, then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>she should give his last greetings to his two sons who
were away in Mercia at the time and seek to counsel
them ever to serve Edward faithfully.</p>

<p>Then towards East Anglia did Wulnoth march with
the King&mdash;towards that very land where first he had
met with Alfred, and where he had seen Edmund the
Martyr lay down his life for the Lord's glory.</p>

<p>And there stretched the army of Ethelwald, like a
host spread over the face of the land.</p>

<p>"Now," said Wulnoth as he gazed upon the foe,
"here we are like to have a battle indeed. And here
must every man prove himself a hero, for there is no
choice but victory or death for us."</p>

<p>And then did the war-horns sound, and the armies
rushed to the fray, and the forces of Ethelwald were
so numerous that they quite surrounded the army of
Edward, as the tide running in surrounds the sentinel
rocks that line the shore.</p>

<p>But Wulnoth and his friends, and all who were
true to Edward, they met the foe undaunted, and the
war-cries rang out and the sword-song was heard, and,
mighty as the host of the foe was, they could not overwhelm
the Saxons.</p>

<p>All day did the battle rage, until the water in the
dykes ran crimson, horrible to see, and the dead lay
thick on the earth, and yet neither side could claim the
victory.</p>

<p>But when the day drew in, and even the champions
were weary and the numbers were thinned, the
Danes made a desperate charge and broke the Saxon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>ranks; and in that charge Wulnoth, sore and wounded,
smote Ethelwald the son of Ethelbald from his saddle,
and laid him dead upon the earth. And then did he
cry to Edward the King and say&mdash;</p>

<p>"Greeting, O King! Now did the Lady Edgiva
prophesy that this would be my last fight, and lo! I
am wounded and nigh to the end. This is my rede,
O King, that ye draw off, for though the Danes are
smitten through and through, by very numbers they
will conquer if ye tarry. Draw off&mdash;the man who
sought thy crown is dead, and the evil will die of itself.
But as for me, I will fight one last fight and then,
good-night!"</p>

<p>And with that Wulnoth pushed forward, and he
came nigh the Danish king Eric, even Eric the Mighty,
and he cried greeting to him&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hail, King Eric!" he said. "I have fought in
many a field of slaughter, but never in such a one as
this. I have slain many of thy holdas in my time, and
now the end draws near. How sayest thou, Eric? I
am a thane of name; I like not to die by common
spear. Come now, and let us twain speak a word, and
if I die I die by a champion's hand, and if I smite thee
down surely I shall follow thee quickly. Skoal, Skoal!&mdash;the
old Northland cry, Eric! Wilt thou go holmgang
with me?"</p>

<p>"Ay, for thou hast slain Ethelwald, and I will slay
thee right gladly," answered the Dane, "and if I die
by thy hand, then honorable is the death."</p>

<p>So these twain met, and they fought, and all around
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>stood still that the champions of pride might play the
man's game unhindered. And it was a mighty fight,
and a good fight, and of it the scalds and the gleeman
sang for many a day.</p>

<p>For Wulnoth smote a blow that cleaved its way
through Eric's left wrist, and Eric struck back with
all his force, and the blow fell on the shoulder of Wulnoth
and nigh severed it; and these two champions
reeled back and looked at each other, and Wulnoth
cried again&mdash;</p>

<p>"Skoal to thee, smiter of blows! Skoal! Methinks
that we shall journey together," and then he changed
his axe into the other hand and again they fought.
And Eric smote Wulnoth sore and deep in the side,
and Wulnoth raised his axe high in his left hand and
smote with all his might, and helm and head were split
together, and King Eric fell side by side with his foe.</p>

<p>Then did Wulnoth raise himself and cry again&mdash;</p>

<p>"Skoal! Skoal to thee, Eric, brave champion!
Skoal to thee, Edward, for both thy foes are slain and
thou shalt reign in peace. Skoal! I &mdash; I &mdash;" and then
his voice failed and he gasped, "Edgiva! Edgiva beloved!
I die," and with that he fell dead across the
body of King Eric.</p>

<p>And the battle stayed, for indeed none could fight
longer. And the Danes buried King Eric on the field,
but the Saxons bore the body of Wulnoth with sorrow
and brought it safely to Edgiva. And the field of that
fight was called amongst men the Field of the Great
Slaughter&mdash;so vast was the number who lay there dead.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span></p>
<p>And the whole of the Saxons made lamentation for
Wulnoth, and they buried him with all honor; and
Edgiva gave his message to his sons and smiled upon
them and then laid her down. And soon her own death
came, and she went to join her husband in the Kingdom
of that Master Whom they had both learnt to
serve.</p>

<p>And Edward became king, and, that the name and
the fame of Wulnoth might not be forgotten, he ordered
that Gyso his gleeman should make this song. And
Gyso obeyed and sang, and they said it was a good
song and a true song, and that Wulnoth was worthy of
the singing.</p>

<p>And so ends the song; and it is for those who read
to say whether it is as Gyso said, fair and true, and
whether the deeds of those days are worthy of honorable
remembrance.</p>

<p>And from across the "has-been" they look, the
heroes of old&mdash;Wulnoth, and Wahrmund, and Osric,
Guthrun, Guthred, and Alfred; and to you, their descendants,
they cry in the cry of the old Northland, to
follow their steps, and be heroes in your day as they
in theirs, and follow the White Christ Whom they
loved and served, when they cast aside the gods of the
Northland.</p>

<p>To you they cry, you sons of the Saxons&mdash;</p>

<p>"Skoal! Skoal! Skoal!"</p>

<h2>FOOTNOTES:</h2>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> This story of Regner Lodbrok is one of the most noted in all
the old sagas, and there are many concerning his wonderful deeds.
Regner was called <em>Lodbrok</em> on account of thus wrapping himself up
in skins to fight the dragon. Some old writers who wrote in Latin
translate the name into <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Villosa femoralia</i>, which means hairy trousers.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> This legend of the death of Regner Lodbrok is the one most
common in his histories. But there is another, and more probable,
story, which tells how he, having been received by Edmund, afterwards
known as the martyr king of East Anglia, was murdered by
the King's huntsman, and hidden in a wood. The body was found
by Regner's dog, who scraped the leaves away and revealed the
crime. For this the huntsman was placed in a boat which was
unseaworthy and cast adrift; and the boat, surviving the tempests,
drifted to Denmark, where the guilty man, to save himself, put the
crime at Edmund's door. As it was East Anglia which was first
invaded by Hungwar and Hubba, and not Northumbria, this story
seems the more probable; and especially so in view of the fact that
Hungwar and Hubba put their royal captive Edmund to death in
the most barbarous fashion afterwards.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> It was at a place called Hoxne, in Sussex, that this battle was
fought; and the spot where it is said that King Edmund hid is
known as Goldbridge. Whether the story of the king cursing the
place is true or not, the legend was known at Hoxne until quite
recently; and no bride or bridegroom would venture to cross
Goldbridge upon their wedding day.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> The body of King Edmund was at first buried secretly by his
friends, but afterwards it was taken up and carried to Badrichesworth,
now called Bury St. Edmunds; and here, later, a monastery
was founded in honor of the Martyr King, by the Danish King
Canute, himself a Christian.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5" id="Footnote_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> King Alfred was born at Wantage, not far from the White
Horse of Berkshire. The White Horse itself, cut in the chalk,
was probably the work of the early Jutes under Hengist and Horsa,
which names, by the way, signify a horse and a mare. The white
horse was the ensign of the Old Saxons; and hence it is, to this
day, found upon the shield of Brunswick and Hanover. There
exists near Wantage, the remains of the ancient <em>long barrow</em> or
burying place, called Weyland Smith's forge, celebrated by Sir
Walter Scott in his novel of "Kenilworth." It owes its name to
the old Norse deity, <em>Volundr</em>, who was the blacksmith of their
mythology, as Vulcan was amongst the Greeks and Romans.</p></div>
